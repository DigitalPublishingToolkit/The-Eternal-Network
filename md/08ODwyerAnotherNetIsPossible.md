# Another Net Is Possible

### Rachel O'Dwyer

The term ‘spectrum’ describes the electromagnetic waves that are used to
transmit everything: radio and television signals, cellular
communications, and data from the Internet of Things. These waves are
made of exactly the same stuff as the visible spectrum of light, but at
frequencies invisible to humans. If you Google ‘spectrum allocation
chart’, you’ll see a range of color-coded maps showing how these
frequencies are divided up: there are blocks for military operations,
blocks for Bluetooth communications, blocks for 4G, blocks for emergency
services, blocks for medical devices, and even blocks for garage-door
openers. Ever since the Titanic sank in a mesh of competing radio
signals, spectrum has been owned by governments and controlled by
national regulators. With the exception of a small set of frequencies
that are allocated for unlicensed uses, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,
licenses for the use of the remaining frequencies are either allocated
to public resources such as national radio broadcasters, or auctioned,
at exorbitant prices, to network operators. And as, in recent years, the
potential for monetizing wireless communications has continued expanding
– 5G, contextual advertisements, virtual reality gaming, fine-tuned
logistics and mobile payments – the issue of spectrum ownership has come
to the fore: Is public or private ownership the best way to manage
wireless communications, or should spectrum be a common resource to
which everyone has access, provided they follow some basic rules?

Ever since radio amateurs built their own crystal sets and surfed the
shortwaves, the history of wireless has been ghosted by alternative
practices that have challenged the ownership and control of spectrum.
Ham-, micro-, and pirate-radio community members cobbled sets together
from everyday domestic items, and experimented with Morse, voice, and,
later, packet radio, to share communications and images in a sort of
proto-internet.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_1] Later, after the opening-up to experimentation of
the ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) bands, and the development
of the 802.11 protocol,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_2] Wi-Fi too became a contested space, with
calls for a wireless commons to be built, using open spectrum. Network
activists were particularly excited by Wi-Fi as a space where users
could experiment with the collectively managing communications, outside
of both the state and the market. Some of the best examples include
guifi.net, a community wireless network in Catalonia and Spain that
currently includes more than 27,000 operational nodes, and initiatives
such as the Consume Network in London (now closed), NYC Mesh in the
United States, and Freifunk in Berlin, to name just a few. Much was also
made of ‘war-driving’ and ‘war-chalking’ practices, wherein activists
allegedly used aesthetic forms of mapping to mark the existence in
public spaces of open and closed wireless nodes.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_3] Communities such as
these advocated for a spectrum commons, through declarations such as
‘The Wireless Commons Manifesto’,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_4] and worked to develop blueprints
for cooperation; including via the application of some of the basic
principles of Nobel Prize-winner Elinor Ostrom’s work on common-pool
resource management,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_5] and the development of extra-legal agreements
such as the FONN Compact, the Pico Peering Agreement, and the Network
Commons License.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_6] In time, innovations in Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP), and hardware ‘virtualization’ (creating virtual
versions of extremely costly cellular infrastructure such as base
stations), pushed forward the development of not only open-source and
community Wi-Fi networks, but also of open-source cellular networks.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_7]

## The Limitations of Networks

With the exception of large-scale projects such as guifi.net, community
wireless networks have come to feel like a niche pursuit – an activity
which was prominent in the golden age of Wi-Fi but which never gained
traction. In the face of contemporary network politics, monolithic
platforms, and large infrastructural rollout, it’s hard to stay
optimistic about such practices. While this article acknowledges the
limitations of community wireless networks, it also explores their
demands for, and experiments with, different models of ownership and
cooperativism, arguing that these have never been more important than
they are now. So, too, that certain elements of their practices – in
imagining, inventing, resisting – contain the seeds of other ways of
networking in the world.

Often, the limitations of community networks are framed in terms of
their technical constraints. Wi-Fi networks are limited by the
technological affordances of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum – they use waves
that by nature don’t travel very far and are easily absorbed by weather
and by the built environment – and by the power transmission regulations
under which such networks operate: because Wi-Fi is communal, power is
reduced to avoid interference. As a consequence, Wi-Fi networks favor
‘line of sight’ links, where wireless antennas are in view of one
another. These characteristics tend to limit the scale and extent of
community Wi-Fi networks. But focusing on the technical limitations of
the communal spectrum risks overlooking the more troubling ideological
limitations of community Wi-Fi network projects.

### 1. Techno-Fetishism

At an ideological level, community network projects often conflate the
specifics of their technical infrastructure with the kinds of social and
economic behaviors the community network hopes to cultivate. Primavera
de Filippi once argued that such technical infrastructure offered ‘an
internet-native model for building community and governance’, for
example.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_8] Thus, non-hierarchical, decentralized or distributed
topologies are often held to actually cultivate equally non-hierarchical
forms of interpersonal cooperation within the network, while technical
features such as the ability of devices to dynamically connect, and for
networks to form and reconfigure without the need for a centralized
intermediary, are confused with principles such as democratic
decision-making and non-hierarchical social structures.

Christina Dunbar-Hester’s work on cooperation in hacker, maker, and
open-source radio communities shows that the opposite may be the
case:[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_9] there are practices at work in the imagined community of the
wireless commons that are strongly exclusionary on the basis of
education, gender, race and class. New entrants to technical and
politicized spaces often experience resistance from the existing
community – there is a need, or implied demand, for one to demonstrate
that one should be accepted, via displays of different forms of
linguistic, technical and/or social capital.

As one example, there is a significant gender gap in digital activist
communities, and in radio activism in particular. As Christina
Dunbar-Hester has said of micro-radio communities, ‘these practices have
a long history of association with white middle-class masculinity’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_10]
This goes back to the exclusively male environments of early wireless
clubs, synonymous with the fantastical ‘boy’ inventor,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_11] right up to
the gender composition of mesh-networking communities today. Often,
there is a denigration of women and a devaluation ‘women’s work’ within
these networked activist communities, however closely certain
historically and stereotypically ‘feminine’ forms of cooperation and
communication may resemble the very forms of cooperation that these
communities hope to cultivate.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_12] Issues of class and race are also
sometimes overlooked in the construction of networked activist
communities. Digital activism is often tied in with communities and
practices that have high cultural capital.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_13] Then, there is also the
cost of participation: when and if community networks engage in
electronic forms of civil disobedience, the consequences may be much
greater for people of color than for their white counterparts.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_14] Then
again, there are instances when it is possible to argue (as Larissa Mann
does, in her work on pirate-radio communities) that exclusion isn’t
always a bad thing:[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_15] in contrast to the agnostic openness of the
open-source community, for example, a level of access-control can be
part of what allows a group to form a coherent identity. All of which
suggests that we have to let go now, if we have not done so already, of
an idealized image of community networks as democratically ‘open’
spaces.

### 2. The Limitations of ‘the Commons’, as Understood Among Community Networks

Community networks may argue that radio spectrum is, and should be
treated as, a ‘commons’, but the way this concept has been utilized
doesn’t challenge contemporary property relations, models of progress or
the subjectivities that capitalist networks cultivate. In 2001, a number
of key individuals involved with alternative wireless networks penned
the Wireless Commons Manifesto, a framework for developing a global,
independent, open, public network. The authors stressed the need to
scale and federate localized wireless networks so that they might
present as a viable alternative to dominant commercial
telecommunications infrastructure, and argued that: ‘the network is a
finite resource which is owned and used by the public, and as such it
needs to be nurtured by the public. This, by its very nature, is a
commons.’[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_16]

As in the above quotation, the most frequent representation of the
commons in wireless activism equates the notion of a spectrum commons
with that of public goods such as national forests or fish stocks. This
pragmatic approach to ‘the commons’ as a particular kind of ‘resource’
that is conducive to collective ownership, akin to Elinor Ostrom’s
definition of ‘common-pool resources’[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_17] is quite distinct from
thinking of it as a set of practices or subjectivities, as suggested by
more radical theorists of ‘the common’ and ‘commoning’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_18]

Ostrom’s work on common-pool resources is instrumental in demonstrating
that not all goods need to be governed through private property, and
suggesting that certain goods might be best provisioned in fluid or
cooperative ways. However, nowadays, in the face of the broader sharing
economy, this appears as good old common sense, rather than radical
economics; and, in the context of community networks, the treatment of
the commons as an economic good per se fails to challenge the ownability
of communications.

Furthermore, cooperation in the wireless commons often includes economic
principles for incentivizing collaboration. The imagined user within the
community wireless network is an economic actor who needs to be nudged
in the right direction with appeals to self-interest. Ostrom goes a long
way toward disproving Garret Hardin’s theory of ‘The Tragedy of the
Commons’, which argues that individuals are too self-interested to
manage resources without price or state regulation.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_19] In contrast,
Ostrom documents many instances where communities have collectively
managed goods outside of public or commercial control. Nonetheless,
Ostrom’s rules for governing the commons tend to focus on competitive
principles for managing cooperation. In line with this argument, Pierre
Dardot and Christian Laval claim that Ostrom’s conception of the
‘commons’ supplies not only a system of rules that can be applied to the
government of a shared resource, but also a set of inducements for
structuring individual behavior. In this sense, they argue, Ostrom is
part of the problematic of neoliberal governmentality, according to
which ‘the conduct of individuals can only be led by a combination of
incentives and disincentives’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_20] By beginning from the assumption
that users are selfish, we may inadvertently create rules that entrench
those behaviors.

Just as the 2001 Wireless Commons Manifesto emphasized the need to scale
beyond the locality of community networks and the propagation
limitations of 2.4 GHz spectrum, the vision of the commons now held by
community wireless networks is often based on a desire to build scalable
alternatives to commercial or state infrastructure, something that’s
increasingly difficult to accomplish in the face of monolithic
platforms. ‘Scalability’ means that the scale of a project may smoothly
be changed (usually increased) without change to the project’s
structuring framework, and so to build, expand, and federate local
relations.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_21] Scalability can be a very good thing, allowing
alternative, non-market forms of cooperation to expand beyond a local
level and so present as reasonable alternatives. However, the concept of
scalability relies on a particular vision of what success or progress
looks like, and it might not be the best one. The anthropologist Anna
Tsing, for example, argues that scalability, wherein ‘progress’ is
defined in terms of the ability to expand projects without transforming
their framing assumptions, is a modernist project that requires project
elements to ignore the messy indeterminacies of individual
encounters,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_22] thus banishing, or overlooking, the kinds of meaningful
diversity that might trouble or change things.

In sum, the ideology of ‘the commons’ that is most common among
community wireless networks inadvertently reproduces many of the
relations that they intend to work against. At the very least, they may
be seen often to proceed from some of the same ideological assumptions
that platform capitalism helps to reproduce – in this case, that: a)
communication and social production are ‘things’ with definable
boundaries that can be parceled out and managed; b) human agents are
economic actors whose individual behavior needs to be nudged in the
right direction; c) the directive to scale and federate should take
precedence over the messiness of local relations.

Finally, it’s increasingly difficult to speak of the commons today, when
modes of open access, sharing, and cooperativism are no longer
antithetical to the functioning of capitalism. Instead, these are now
the very practices that shore up the system and keep things afloat. As
neoliberal economies suffer through environmental degradation and
falling profit margins, forms of social production such as these are now
drawn inside the market, in a move which Paolo Virno refers to as the
‘communism of capital’,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_23] and George Caffentzis as the ‘neoliberal
plan B’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_24] If there was ever a moment when community Wi-Fi could be
seen as diametrically opposed to commercial networks, that moment has
passed. Increasingly, commercial networks see community-operated and
maintained spaces as ‘positive externalities’ – free goods – to be
exploited. One example is the now-common practice wherein commercial
mobile networks offload their own congested traffic into open Wi-Fi
networks.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_25] The complexity of the current situation makes it much
harder to speak of open networks, or resistance in these spaces, as
alternative to, or outside the dominant economic system.

## Imagining Alternatives

I found these issues hard to grapple with. If community networks and
their alternatives are not the answer, where, and to what else, might we
begin to look? Is it perhaps, rather, about asking different questions
of existing network infrastructures? Instead of asking how community
networks might present alternatives to commercial infrastructures and
platforms, for example, could it be more fruitful now to ask what seeds
of resistance and ways of commoning might be flourishing within these
commercial spaces themselves? Imagining, or fictioning, offers one
approach. At a Radical Networks event in New York,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_26] October 2015,
Rob Ray and Adam Rothstein presented a speculative narrative, entitled
‘A History of the Future of Solarpunk Ham Radio Club’. Let’s start with
their story:

In 2016, three coastal super-storms flooded most of the West Coast of
the United States, destroying all critical infrastructure. A small,
previously unknown group calling themselves ‘The Solarpunk Ham Radio
Club’ emerged to fill the communications void. Building on the detritus
of a failed infrastructure, they re-established autonomous networks of
communication; drying out coaxial cable, rescuing speakers and batteries
from abandoned vehicles and constructing antennas from salvaged tin cans
and scrap metals.

This was not so much about rebuilding as it was about working *within*
disorientation, distress and breakdown. The new infrastructure that grew
up was a ‘Jugaad’, built via the quick-and-dirty engineering of whatever
was readily available: [^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_27] ad hoc mesh-networks and phone systems;
low-powered FM; packet-radio internet; hacked FRS and GMRS radios, and a
D-star repeater controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The members established
skill-shares, and taught analog radio and basic electronics. The
Solarpunks couldn’t duplicate the old infrastructural models, but nor
did they want to. Through making-do and repurposing, they found ways of
working together and learning from one another, and these practices made
their networks resilient in a way that monetary investment alone could
not have.

As described here, the Solarpunk Ham Radio Club is a ‘degrowth’ movement
for amateur radio makers. ‘Solarpunk ham radio’ indicates a shifting
away from many of the features of information capitalism, such as
centralized network control and ubiquitous surveillance; it also
constitutes an attempt to move past some of the common pitfalls of
digital activism, and to establish a new ethics of communications
infrastructure. The Solarpunk Radio story featured here reimagines
relationships to communications and the materiality of networks, where
connectivity relies as much on social bonds as technical architecture.
The model stresses self-governed networks and peer-production, but with
a focus-shift from universal service provision to individual
applications and use-cases, and from macro-level infrastructures to
quite local and situated innovations. There is also an emphasis on
material ingenuity, in the ways the networks are designed and
implemented.

I find this story useful as a blueprint for beginning to rethink
commoning in community networks: not as a project that requires
decentralized topologies or scale or economic incentives, but as a set
of practices that can support, nourish, and innovate from
subject-positions of precarity and disillusionment.

This Solarpunk-imaginary has echoes of Lizzie Borden’s *Born in Flames,*
a 1983 film that depicts a future pirate-radio community peopled by
black and queer women who – finding that they are still marginalized in
the aftermath of a social-democratic revolution that has failed to bring
justice to women and minorities, and is instead backsliding into
pre-revolutionary white-patriarchal structures – use wireless media to
‘reformulate desire and rekindle hope’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_28] Two pirate radio stations
run by women – Radio Ragazza and Phoenix Radio – come together to
contest the situation by troubling mainstream representations of their
post-revolutionary society. Using guerilla tactics, they take over
mainstream media in order to ‘redirect meaning \[…\] reclaim the
language’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_29] Like the Ray and Rothstein’s Solarpunk-imaginary,
Borden’s film constitutes anti-capitalist critique; the film can also be
read as a critique of left-hacker culture and its promise of a
universalism and equality which, in practice, threatens to betray its
constituent social movements, and all of their most radical
possibilities. Both the Solarpunk fiction above, and *Born in Flames*,
model ways of using infrastructure as a mode of resistance; in both
cases, a radical aesthetics is performed from a position of precarity
and disequilibrium. Significantly, both of these fictions describe ways
of working *through* dystopia, creating political agency in situations
that may seem hopeless or beyond redemption. See also, Anna Tsing’s
work: ‘What emerges in damaged landscapes, beyond the call of industrial
promise and ruin?’.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_30]

### Inventive Material Practices

As well as being a speculative imaginary of how our networks could be
otherwise, The Solarpunk Ham radio story models some of the
possibilities of existent inventive material practices that run counter
to network capitalism, including the hacking, repurposing and
reverse-engineering practices inherent to community wireless networks,
Shanzai phone culture,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_31] and Indian Jugaad culture.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_32]

Inventive material practices have been a part of community radio
cultures from their inception.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_33] In the early days of amateur radio,
makers shared details of the best domestic materials with which to build
radio sets, including bicycle parts, steel bed frames, and cake tins;
the Quaker Oats can was a particular favorite.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_34] More recently,
Katrina Jungnickel’s 2016 sociological study of backyard Wi-Fi
technologists describes the rich material cultures of community wireless
networks, involving scavenging, gleaning, signal stumbling,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_35] and
various ad hoc modifications to off-the-shelf electronics.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_36] Today,
many wireless communities around the globe hold workshops in, for
example, antenna-building; maker sites detail how to home-make radio
antennas and waveguides with coffee cans, electric fans, Pringles tins,
and kitchenware,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_37] while software radio communities are putting
together powerful devices that can mimic base stations, using cheap USB
television tuners sourced online.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_38]

Collated by the artist Roel Roscam Abbing, *Pretty Fly for a Wi-Fi* is
an archive of wireless antennae built from everyday materials. Pots and
pans, cans and plastic, discarded kitchen implements, and other trashed
items are combined with careful calibration. For the project, and as a
testament to a vision of alternative infrastructure, the artist built,
tested, and documented these experimental designs for antennae,
revisiting ‘their histories, origins and uses’ in the process.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_39] One
image shows a plastic CD-container spool, now-defunct, at the center of
an antenna; others feature, respectively, a used-sardine-can antenna
casing; a sieve; a wok, a plastic water-bottle, and a potato-steamer.
Each object evokes an alternative internet, engaging the individuals and
groups who have tried to reconfigure the dominant infrastructure to meet
specific needs and desires. These inventive material practices, often
falling somewhere between art-making, critical design interventions, and
responses to material necessities, articulate a challenge to the
business models of the platform and the commercial network, as follows:

First, these inventive practices provide a necessary antidote to the
proprietary nature of network infrastructure. Two significant
developments in open-source wireless networking have emerged from
willfully inventive actions such as these, in which proprietary hardware
devices were opened, examined, and played around with until the engineer
in question could reliably reproduce their schematics. In 2004, the
Catalonian engineer Ramon Roca purchased a bunch of Linksys wireless
routers on a trip to California. His examination of them would become
the starting point for guifi.net, the world’s largest independent
wireless network, running through Spain. Likewise, the open-source
programmer Harald Welte’s 2006 decision to reverse-engineer some base
stations he purchased on eBay formed the basis for much of the
open-source cellular software underpinning the Rhizomatica network.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_40]

Second, the pedagogy that surrounds inventive material practices such as
these itself often embodies a belief that both this knowledge, and the
signals it enables to be conveyed, are themselves a kind of commons. If
you attend a NETworkshop at Weise7,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_41] or at Radical Networks,[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_42]
for example; or an antenna-building BattleMesh workshop;[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_43] you’ll see
that material know-how is circulated and given away for free.

Third; making, tinkering around and taking things apart helps to make
both the models and the politics of wireless systems more explicit.
Sending a file over a packet-radio network, or delving into what it
takes to build your own ad hoc mesh, introduces a user to the ins and
outs of communication protocols. As such, this sort of ‘messing around’
is so much more than ‘just’ messing around – it’s a political practice.
And, while we shouldn’t idealize these practices, and need also to
recognize the ways in which they are often reincorporated into
commercial systems, we should also recognize the spaces in which they
occur as those of imaginative and materially discursive resistance to
capitalist enclosure. We might go so far as to suggest that it’s in
these kinds of practices, rather than in manifesto-style calls for open
access, that ‘commoning’ truly occurs.

### Local and Offline Networks

One of the most intriguing aspects of the Solarpunk Ham radio imaginary
is the way it abandons typical modernist ideas of progress and success
when it looks to the future of community networking. These are networks
where scalability and seamless global connectivity are no longer
desirable end-points. Instead of viewing the often limited, often closed
spaces of community wireless networks as signs of failure, could we
start to think of these as blueprints for other ways of networking in
the world?

In an effort to incorporate more-than-human entities into networks, the
artist Tega Brain designs wireless routers to function according to
particular environmental constraints, so that seamless connectivity is
no longer the end goal. In the 2016 device-series *Being Radiotrophic*,
Brain has created three wireless routers, devices that are normally
designed to pick up broadband signals and transmit them through an urban
space as effectively as possible, and made their signals contingent on
haptic external elements. ‘An Orbit’ produces signals that wax and wane
with the lunar cycle, while ‘The Woods’ is a hybrid house-plant/router
whose connective properties are disrupted if the plant isn’t watered
frequently enough. ‘Open Flame’ associates internet connectivity with a
lit candle, cutting out whenever the candle is extinguished.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_44] Much
like Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby’s explorations of electromagnetic
connectivity and associated devices in *Hertzian Tales*, these
speculative objects are material prompts to rethink connectivity.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_45]
In Brain’s devices, wireless is not the seamless, global mesh of the
5G-imaginary. Instead, the devices probe, disrupt and cause the viewer
to speculate about the kinds of contingencies and care that
communications may require in future.

Larissa Mann’s research concerns pirate-radio stations run by diasporic
communities in Brooklyn, which, Mann suggests, are a way for
marginalized communities to claim space for themselves, to build and
reinforce their own communities through language and culture, and to
circulate important information and resources. In contrast to the idea
of radio as a boundless broadcast medium, many of these pirate stations
operate within very localized geographies. And, far from offering the
kind of open access that is so often extolled in certain forms of
alternative media, access to participation in these stations must be
negotiated. In terms of material practices (and despite the relative
density of licensed radio stations in the New York area), it is notable
that these communities continue to use analog broadcast technologies
instead of availing themselves of internet alternatives such as online
messaging, social media or digital radio technologies.[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_46]

Here, these community networks present with material practices that are
*not* integral to the sphere of cutting-edge digital practices such as
open-source, blockchain and decentralized mesh networks, but, rather, as
revenants of contemporary communication technologies’ past. These
networks are not scalable, nor do they strive for scalability; they are
neither distributed nor decentralized, but, rather, localized, finite,
pragmatic; perhaps even closed; and they may be managed in agonistic
ways. How do these networks allow us to think differently about the
limitations of wireless media? Might we view their characteristic
propagation and physical interactions with specific environments as
unique strengths, rather than as limitations? Perhaps we might also
re-think the roles of noise and positive disruption in our networks?
Could these, in a real sense, be contributing more-than-human agencies
to our networks, enabling more-than-human connectivity?

Practices such as these offer other models for the commons and the
community network: models that are not governed by ideas of progress,
scalability, techno-social democracy, or by game-theory models of human
cooperation. Such practices may be hidden in plain sight; often they
emerge from very pragmatic relationships at the margins of neoliberal
capitalism, from crisis and ruin and from not having enough. They are
not utopian or ideal; they exemplify micro-strategies that a) work and
b) embrace positions of pragmatism, of precarity; of locality rather
than scalability; and of difference, agonism and even discord, rather
than technologically enabled cooperation; of seamfulness and patchiness
rather than seamless connectivity.

[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_35]: Arguably, this attitude extends not only to hardware and software
    interventions in wireless networks, but also to the mapping of radio
    signals and network connections. ‘Stumbling’ is a practice wherein
    community network users move through a geographic area in the
    vicinity of their network, to see if they can locate the signal of
    the network and form a new network connection. If a signal can be
    identified, a line-of-sight base station will be installed to extend
    the network. The term ‘stumbling’ captures the embodied and
    imprecise nature of the practice (not unlike the opportunistic
    ‘poking around’ involved in ‘circuit-bending’ on the listen for new
    connections), which is quite different to the ‘polarity
    calculations’ of commercial engineering.

[^08ODwyerAnotherNetIsPossible_38]: In 2013, hackers started to repurpose USB television tuners in
    order to reach a range of frequencies from 24 MHz to over 10000 MHz.
    Such tuners currently cost approximately 20 € and are readily
    available from Amazon and Alibaba, for example. Combined with
    open-source applications such as GQRS, broadcast signals can easily
    be turned into readable data. Marc DaCosta describes applications
    including downloading images form weather satellites as they fly
    overhead; tracking airplanes that fly nearby; and even using
    information from unintentional radio emissions to reconstruct
    computer interfaces. Marc Da Costa, ‘How To Explore The Hidden World
