# The Never-ending Network: A Repetitive and (thus) Differentiating Concept of Our Time

### Clemens Apprich

## I.

Is a network centralized, decentralized, or distributed?[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_1] May it even
be a scale-free network?[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_2] The question of what exactly a network is
birthed a new research area at the interface of mathematics – in
particular graph theory and statistics – biology, chemistry, computer
science, psychology, physics, and sociology. Network science, as this
area was called, deals with complex networks, such as food webs,
electric grids, transport systems, neural circuits, computer or social
nets, by dissecting real-world phenomena into abstract representations
of nodes and links. Representing biological, physical, and social
realities in network terms has the objective to build predictive models
and extrapolate future behavior from past and existing data. In this
way, networks provide orientation in an increasingly complex world, and,
by virtue of their explanatory power, have arguably become the universal
concept of our time.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_3] They are depictions, figurations, and
projections at the same time. They are, in an odd way, that which is
depicted, and that which makes the depiction possible. Networks are
signifiers in a world that has been described as being without
signification.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_4] Given this postmodern paradox, we might be better off
asking not what a network is, thus getting caught in an endless chain of
representations, but rather understanding the network’s causes and
effects. Following Gilles Deleuze, we might ask: What brings the network
into the world, both in terms of the enabling conditions for this
all-encompassing concept and the actual formation of the network as a
specific expression of the time we live in?[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_5] It has become a truism
to say that we live in a networked world, and it is more and more
difficult to imagine a world outside the network. However, the eternal
return in network form, which can feel like an endless repetition of the
same, also suggests the possibility of difference. In this essay, I will
look into this possibility with regard to digital media networks by
contrasting them with recent debates about the epistemic impossibility
of accessing the world – networked or not.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_6]

Let me start by making some fairly obvious observations, in order to
clear the way. Firstly, networks have no beginning or end. Each node
within a network may be an intersection to another network. Hence, a
linear understanding of a network is impossible, because it cannot
encompass all of a network’s possible forms. To think about network
forms as means of social, economic, or cultural expression necessitates
a critical reflection of the respective desires that have spawned these
very forms. For example, random networks are a direct expression of a
mathematical desire for an absolute form,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_7] whereas scale-free
networks actualize the empirical complexity of social, but also
biological, physical, and other realities.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_8] Secondly, networks evolve
over time. Instead of trying to essentialize a specific network form by
making it the standard for all other forms, it is more insightful to
evaluate its genealogy.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_9] The invention of a worldwide computer
network, for instance, was not a singular act of history. Rather, the
emergence of the internet involved a historical folding as a combination
of heterogeneous and opposing vectors, from technical developments (e.g.
TCP/IP versus OSI-standard), to institutional frameworks (e.g. ARPANET,
NSFNET, Minitel), to social and individual practices (e.g. within Usenet
and hacker cultures, or the first Bulletin Board Systems). Here the idea
of random networks laid the imaginary ground for their later
implementation as a technology of decentralization and redistribution.
Thirdly, networks follow certain rules. They may be virtually limitless,
in the sense that they can morph into almost every form, but they are
nonetheless limited in their actual formation. According to Alexander
Galloway, a computer network relies on certain protocols, which specify
how the network operates.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_10] By setting the rules for the transmission
of data from one computer to another, from one application to another,
but also from one user to another, protocols steer and control possible
behavior within a network such as the internet.

A protocol-based network has little in common with the still prevalent
idea of an uncontrolled, anarchic space of data flows. However, such a
network imaginary creates expectations of what a network can or should
do. It influences decisions about the actual form and implementation of
networks, and, similar to protocols, how the implemented network shapes
and structures the world. In this sense, Galloway’s focus on
protocological control is somehow misleading. Certainly, the material
basis of what we call the internet – which in its basic functioning is a
top-level network that connects a series of sub-networks – consists of a
range of protocols, summarized in the internet protocol suite. But the
model entails more than TCP/IP – that is the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP), which runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), and
already has ‘control’ in its name. Even though TCP/IP are foundational
protocols in the suite, which make it possible to break up large data
sets into smaller packages so that they can be sent over the network
without loss, they are not the only ones. Also part of the transport
layer is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). UDP is used for establishing
low latency and loss-tolerating connections on the internet, like voice
over IP or video streaming. In contrast to TCP, which is considered a
reliable protocol for host-to-host communication, UDP might lose some of
its datagrams according to its best-effort approach, a circumstance that
implies an entirely different understanding of what communication
is.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_11] UDP does not need a ‘handshake’ to establish a connection
before an exchange can happen. It just wants to connect.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_12]
Consequently, it encapsulates a completely different imaginary than the
strict and control-based network of Galloway’s imagination. Translated
into cultural theory, UDP would evoke the idea of a promiscuous network,
corresponding more to George Bataille’s general economy than to a rigid
reading of Deleuze’s postscript on the societies of control.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_13]

## II.

Why is this of importance? Because networks are not just descriptive,
but rather performative. They not only represent the world, they also
have real-world effects. Network technologies play a crucial role in the
cultural logic of late capitalism because they respond directly to the
socio-economic shift that has restructured the global system over the
last thirty years.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_14] Even though, on the surface, digital capitalism
may have solidified into platforms, its underlying structure still
follows a network logic.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_15] I am not simply talking about the fact
that all common platforms (e.g. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix,
Spotify) still rely on the material, and so protocological,
infrastructure of the internet, but that, in a very literal sense, the
network, or rather the analytical diagram based on networks, constitutes
the ‘motor’ of these platforms. Network analytics is far from being
dead.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_16] It continues to fuel capitalist value production in its
digital form by providing the tools to sift through the ever-increasing
amount of data and extract from it fast-selling information. In doing
so, data models are undergirded by the homophilic assumption that the
friend of my friend might also be a suitable friend for me.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_17] We are
constantly being lumped together, in order to predict our buying
behavior, our credit, or our desirability score. The network has become
such a powerful force today, because it determines how the world sees us
and, by the same token, how we see the world. It would therefore be
negligent to disregard the still central role that networks play in the
constitution of our subjectivity. As linked-up data bundles we have
reached a crossroads with regards to our networked future. On the one
hand, we are facing a systemic stupidity, which declares everything,
even our luggage, to be connected and smart, thereby yielding nothing
more than a stale repetition of consumerism.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_18] On the other hand,
there are socio-technical networks at our fingertips, which enable true
innovation by virtue of their transindividual potential. Today it is
possible for individuals to be part of different social spheres at the
same time. We are thus, potentially, traversed by different networks and
open to diverse associations as the precondition for a genuine – because
collective – subjectivity.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_19]

According to Katherine Hayles this subjectivity is not only
characterized by traversing different social networks, but also by the
transition from deep to hyper attention.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_20] Today’s subject is
embedded in a digital and networked environment with the effect that
(human) cognition gears toward hyper attentiveness. In contrast to deep
attention, which is associated with traditional knowledge acquisition
and involves single information streams and long focus times, hyper
attention is characterized by the ability to quickly scan significant
amounts of data and combine them in certain, albeit ephemeral patterns.
This generational shift in cognitive styles is supported by the thesis
that humans and technology have always co-evolved, in the sense that
human beings and technical artifacts are mutually amplified.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_21] What
is new, according to Hayles, is the fact that with digital media
networks and media-rich environments, the speed of such an ontogenetic
evolution across generations has increased significantly. Technical
systems, according to Hayles and others, affect the physiological wiring
of the brain, and altered human cognition in turn stimulates
technological development.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_22] In this reciprocity, new cognitive
assemblages emerge, which differ from networks in the way that they
enable contiguity in a ‘fleshly sense’ and make dynamic interactions
between human and nonhuman cognizers tangible.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_23] Inspired by
neuroscience and cognitive science, the idea behind Hayles’s work is to
acknowledge various roles of cognition in human and nonhuman life,
thereby granting cognitive agency to technical devices as well.

Like other approaches in new materialism or speculative realism, such as
actor-network theory (ANT) or object-oriented ontology (OOO), Hayles
objects to an anthropocentric view of the world. Similarly to Jane
Bennett, a prominent figure of new materialism, she attributes agential
powers to assemblages of human and nonhuman actors, which are able to
perform cognitive tasks.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_24] Although this line of thinking is highly
ambiguous,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_25] the redistribution of agency across a network of actants
follows the material turn toward what Manuel DeLanda coined as a ‘flat
ontology’.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_26] Within this ontology, assemblages form on the surface of
the material world and allow for an ontogenetic understanding of
materiality. They are, in this sense, the analogue counterpart to
digital networks. While digital networks follow the binary and
abstracted logic of inclusion and exclusion,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_27] assemblages invoke
quantitative and qualitative continua.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_28] Beyond a symbolic
construction of reality, the assemblage enacts the idea that all things
exist equally. Instead of viewing the world through human experience,
new materialists assert that there is no privileged ontological status
of one thing over another. They ask for new forms of critique that dump
the social, that is symbolically constructed, reality of postmodern
thinking. Human reasoning, in this reading, is not sufficient to explain
complex cognitive processes, such as interpretation, decision, and
choice. Access to reality is not only mediated by higher consciousness,
but also interpenetrated by technical systems. It is therefore no
surprise when Geoffrey Hinton, godfather of so-called connectionism, a
branch of AI research that promotes artificial neural networks, takes
the same line by claiming that reasoning is the last step in what we
call thinking.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_29] In accordance with Hayles’s cognitive pyramid,
reasoning as part of conscious modes of awareness is built on top of
nonconscious cognition, which is built on material processes.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_30]

## III.

My aim in this essay is not to pit networks against assemblages, which
would be futile as they have more in common than not, but rather to show
why the concept of assemblages is put forward as an alternative to
networks in current debates about digital cultures. Although I am well
aware that the heterogenous approaches in new materialist thinking
cannot be lumped together, I am wondering – as does Galloway – why
contemporary theoretical models of flat ontology resemble, in so many
aspects, the latest drive toward technocapitalism.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_31] In particular
speculative realism (see Quentin Meillassoux) and object-oriented
ontology (see Graham Harman), both of which have resisted alignment with
the broader project of new materialism, can be seen to express the
conditions of a fully-automated capitalist society, comprised of human
and notably nonhuman actors. These philosophies defy any form of
symbolic abstraction thereby turning against reason itself. In
philosophical realism nothing lies outside the real and, as a
consequence, ontology comes before epistemology. As such, proponents of
a flat ontology are not interested in the possibility of critically
reflecting the world. Epistemic access to the world is simply another
relation on a flat ontological plane.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_32] Why is this of concern?
Because the rejection of epistemology is consistent with the claim that
all theory has ended.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_33] Deeply rooted in what was once called
Californian Ideology,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_34] this claim mirrors the technocapitalist
promises of the 90s. In an odd twist in the history of the present, we
are witnessing the revival of a hackneyed idea: a self-referential
economic system, inspired by biology and operating on autopoiesis.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_35]
The idea of ontogenetic evolution thus plays right into an ideology
that, by default, conceals (human) labor in order to uphold the fetish
of self-generating value production. What is new in digital
technocapitalism is the fact that complex and elaborated algorithms push
toward the transformation of the mode of production by fine-tuning the
value extraction process.

There is clearly a problem here in terms of possibilities for critique.
While algorithmic subsumption has become real, the idea of criticizing,
let alone changing, this reality is dismissed by contemporary
philosophy. If everything is as important as anything else, then nothing
really matters and no political decision must be made.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_36] Granted,
things are a little more complicated than that. Given today’s complex
and entangled world, the advantages of a productive attentiveness to
material processes or the destabilization of the Western subject with
its ‘enlightened’ rationalism are undeniable. However the negative
conception of knowledge, based on the thesis that the world either
recedes (Harman) or resists (Hayles) human rationality, leaves us
without any possibility to – at least intellectually – engage with it.
If one cannot know what an object is in itself, all that is left to know
is when one’s conception of this object fails to work.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_37] But how does
one know when it fails if there is no knowledge of what an object, and
so one’s relation to this object, really is? How can we discriminate
between nonconscious processes and discrete real objects? If the
nonconscious represents a large part of human cognition and is – in
contrast to unconscious mental processes – inaccessible to analysis,
then any attempt to understand the world around us must fail. Yet, at
the same time, there are good arguments for the idea that reality is not
simply flattened but stratified – or maybe even networked.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_38] As I
initially noted, the idea of the network is not so much geared toward
what something *is*, but rather how it *works*. In this respect, the
epistemological question is still of relevance. Especially so, as
algorithms, that is knowable objects that can be reverse
engineered,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_39] structure our perception of the world. Against a flat
ontology, I want to argue for an epistemology that takes human as well
as other experiences into account when it comes to an increasingly
data-driven reality. Here we can see a return of the network on a
micro-level: whereas the 90s was all about network politics on a
macro-level,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_40] recently the network has creeped into every fiber of
the so-called digital service industry (Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook,
Microsoft). Working on the premise of clustering and segmentation, these
platforms primarily involve the monetization of user activity based on
network parameters.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_41]

One might fairly object that I haven’t offered an account of the further
potential of networks so far. The repetitive, yet differentiating,
faculty becomes clear when we think again of the ‘identity politics’ of
digital networks. The prevailing assumption that birds of a feather
flock together,[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_42] has without doubt turned the emancipatory idea of
social media into one of poorly gated networks of homophily.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_43] Yet
these new modes of identification are not merely a repetition of the
same; they enable a constant proliferation. With each repetition, the
network actualizes a slightly different identity, a fact that can be
witnessed in the work of data analytics companies. As John
Cheney-Lippold has shown, the networked infrastructure of the internet,
and the subsequent ability to track user behavior, has led to a ‘new
algorithmic identity’, based on statistical inference to determine one’s
age, class, gender, and race.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_44] The interesting aspect of
Cheney-Lippold’s argument is that these ‘hard categories’ are not found
from one crop of data, but are constantly (re)actualized. Each time a
user moves from one web page to another, the identity categories are
updated.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_45] Hence a user’s ascribed gender can and may change as new
data about them is gathered. The algorithms, initially built to enable
marketers to target users with advertising, content, and services, allow
for a fluid formation of identity, which transmutes with each
cycle.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_46] What is more, the fluidity of this algorithmic identity also
affects its categorization, so that from the algorithm’s point of view,
it is totally fine if the user is 58 percent male, 32 percent female,
and 10 percent ‘other’. However, at some point a decision has to be made
whether the user belongs in this or that category, because the data
eventually serves a real-world purpose (marketing). The problem here
then is not so much that algorithms help make sense of an
ever-increasing data stream, but that capitalist logic necessitates a
retrograde identity politics. The identity is not found in the subject
as such, rather the subject’s identity is constructed on the basis of
very specific network analytics, which mimics the underlying assumptions
of a (racist, sexist, and otherwise discriminating) society. Yet such
technology could be put to work differently, for different purposes and
ends. Again, we find ourselves at a crossroads. One sign points to a
‘reticular pessimism’, where a networked mode of control predetermines
every possible outcome.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_47] Another sign points to a new algorithmic
reality, which, if its contingency is embraced, might lead to a new
politics of possibility.[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_48] In this sense, the
story of the network truly is never-ending.

[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_41]: The actual nuts and bolts of data analysis entails finding
    ‘similarities’ between distinct network nodes (or, users).

[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_45]: In the same manner an artificial neural network, when applied to
    the ‘real’ world, is never effectively trained off, because with
    each interaction (e.g. a user-request via a virtual assistant) the
    whole network – respectively its weights – re-adjusts. This also
    hints to the ‘social’ component of these systems, whose categories
    are actualized on the basis of not only one, but multiple users.

[^04ApprichNeverEndingNetwork_46]: A good example of the fluidity of a data-encoded identity is
    *Probably Chelsea*, an artwork by Heather Dewey-Hagborg: thirty
    variations of possible portraits of Chelsea Manning that have been
    algorithmically generated by an analysis of her DNA. The artwork
    ‘shows just how many ways your DNA can be interpreted as data, and
    how subjective the act of reading DNA really is. \[…\] It is a
    refutation of outmoded notions of biologically inscribed identity
    and a testament to the commonality of all, a molecular solidarity
    that is clearly present even at the cellular level.’ Heather
