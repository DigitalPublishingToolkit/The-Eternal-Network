# Molecular Sex and Polymorphic Sensibilities

### Johanna Bruckner

Paleontologists would perhaps understand the present time as the outcome
of a failed experiment with sex.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_1] This text presents a number of
propositions as to how recent conceptions of the molecularization of the
body might crystallize in a redistribution of the sensible. The mobility
of pleasure and knowledge as capital, the expansion of global supply
chains, logistical computing, planetary sharing economies, and
transformations in ecological systems all have implications for human
relations within the world’s political configurations. These new
economic and social orders have largely benefited from advances in
molecular research, hormonal and libidinal biology, virology, and
sex/design. They enhance the human body, the molecular body, and employ
it as biochemical and geopolitical material. Algorithms increasingly
penetrate the micro- and nanostructures of our physical, artificial, and
sexual bodies, to provide data sets for further economic and political
applications. For example, biological material is used to explore the
genetic engineering of sex and citizenship. Gene discovery software and
research allow biological materials to be encoded, forming a basis for
the invention of new physical and artificial bodies, and notions of how
their sexualities might perform. The imagination of sex is one of
sex/design. Furthermore, nanotechnologies and artificial intelligence
shape the human experience of pleasure through technical and biomedical
interventions, such as robots acting as erotic partners, or through
pharmaceutical experimentation, where feeling is converted into a
techno-sensory product. Biological substance, then, is translated into
fluid networks of information, opening up new spheres of intellectual
and molecular property. The chemical industries have situated the
desires of bodies within an ensemble of social relations, in which the
libidinal economy serves the sex/design of biocapitalism. In the
‘pharmacopornographic era’, capitalism, pornography, and the
pharmaceutical industry merge to form a control society that
infiltrates, penetrates, and mutates, engineering our desires from the
level of hormones to pervasive media images and risk technology.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_2] In
contemporary aesthetic economies, pleasure is increasingly experienced
as a fragile and virtual realm. Given this techno-sensual modification
of human feeling, the body is continuously subjected to speculative
alteration.

How might these scenarios, in which the body is thrown into a chaotic
and unpredictable molecular world, enact particular situations of
molecular revolutionary potential, situations that might allow for the
reordering of contemporary sex/design regimes to make way for a
micropolitics of the sensible? Which affectively diffracted
temporalities are needed for bodies to align beyond the boundaries of
representation? Within which bodily conceptions can sensual and
energetic forces coexist in interrelation? Research into the
molecularization of human and artificial existence clearly becomes a
matter of ethical and political concern. Advances in molecular research
offer a framework for recalibrating our entangled relations with the
sensible world around us. Through the perpetual bending of and movement
among and between human, animal, technology, sex, and atmosphere, the
molecular shapes a world beyond the tangible. It pushes at the limits of
the human sensorium and invents technological prostheses that now have
the capacity to disorganize, reconfigure, and redistribute sensible
relations and the patterns with which subjects comprehend the world.

## I.

To begin I will briefly reflect on the molecular from a labor
perspective, since in the dialectic between accumulation and
destitution, the molecular constitutes specific autonomies, which I will
later consider in greater detail in light of Karen Barad’s work. In the
final third of the 20^th^ century, work moved away from the Fordist
ethos of production and toward global networks of information and
finance and the realms of desire. The subsequent economic reorganization
of work valued the intellectual, cognitive worker through the semiotic
production of meaning, and the workplace became flexible, no longer
confined to the factory. Stimulated by the dissolution of labor, life
and leisure, neoliberal victories over aesthetic value led to the
valorization of desire as semiotics. Today’s post-Fordist regimes of
cognitive labor depend on technologies as machines of desire, producing
affective experiences as systems of labor.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_3] Considering these
machines of desire in their molecular operational processes – as a
‘microphysics of the unconscious’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_4] – they seem to exist as affective
molecular aggregates. Dependent on their cognitive laborer, their viral
host, they stimulate the constitution of social formations and abstract
connectivities. So, if we view the process of affection/being affected
by technology not as an appropriative strategy but rather as a
metamorphic virus, the machine, as well as our relationship to it, may
be a catalyzing motor to break away from capital’s extraction and
exploitation of our desires through affect’s potential indeterminacy.

## II.

Against this background of the transformation of the world via molecular
bodies and their intimacies, my video installation *Molecular Sex*
(2020) proposes a sex robot aimed at liberating normative technology-led
worldviews of intimate relations. I chose to feature a sexbot because of
the uncanny parallels between modalities of queerness and the
performance of plastic. I am interested in the links between sex,
plastic, and non-reproduction. Objects of sexual pleasure are chemically
linked to the very plastics that, in their molecular texture, make
sexual indifferences possible. Plastics carry their queerness into sex,
inhibiting sexual reproduction. Sexual difference may not even turn out
to have a future, as plastic mirrors a form of becoming based on
technological and bacterial merging, rather than the reproductive
ability of organic creatures.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_5] Plastic is actualizing a queer
techno-bacterial future, since the texture of plastic functions
according to the logic of dispersion and polymorphic accumulation. It is
less a substance than the antithesis of a substance; a paradigm in which
substance is transformed into a way of being without stable presence or
meaning.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_6]

![Fig. 1: Molecular Sex (still), Johanna Bruckner, 2020. 4K Video.](imgs/10.1.jpg)

<br/>

The sexbot’s plastics are composed of an array of chemicals, produced in
precarious multi-layered processes, primarily in China. In addition to
the molecules referred to as plastic, plasticizers are added for
pliability, color, or heat resistance. Perhaps the most infamous of
these is bisphenol A (BPA), one of a number of chemicals notorious for
their reproductive toxicity. BPA blocks the human ability to reproduce
through both an overexposure to the hormone estrogen and by way of
endocrine disruptors that mimic hormones in the body and interfere with
their functions. This sometimes has the effect of queering the gender of
the body it has penetrated. Such chemicals are generally imperceptible
but can have drastic effects on our, and other species’, bodies.
Moreover, microplastics – multitudinous species that are slowly but
irreversibly changing the environment – hold up a mirror to the world.
These complex bacterial meshworks infiltrate synthetic surfaces,
reproducing and destroying each other, mutating and developing into new
organisms dependent on the sources of energy unlocked by carbon. The
reproductive systems of many creatures allow them to change sex or
reproduce by cellular division. Queer new worlds are inadvertently being
birthed from the human quest for alien, synthetic pleasures.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_7]

The sexbot in *Molecular Sex* acts as a prosthesis for the disconnecting
and reconnecting body parts that circulate systemically in the virtual
world. It dissolves into the atmospheres that surround it, using these
body parts to inhale and exhale and to perform as various entities
during the video. During the work, the robot learns its existence as a
technoid ‘trans/material’ and ‘tranimal’ being,[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_8] and in so doing
transforms existing principles of pleasure. First, it performs both as
and with a brittle star, a deep-sea brainless animal whose body is a
metamorphosing optical and sensual system. Second, it performs both as
and as a host of the Wolbachia bacterium, which distorts lovemaking and
sex, its bodily fluids accumulating into something like smart bombs for
aleatory speciation. Third, it interacts with intersex persons, since
molecular gene research has discovered that the future of sex
determination involves an array of sexual variations and practices
rather than a binary structure. The sexbot’s plastic figurations create
penetrable entities that are imperceptibly but irreversibly changing our
environment.

![Fig. 2: Molecular Sex (still), Johanna Bruckner, 2020. 4K Video.](imgs/10.2.jpg)

<br/>

Let’s give these three scenarios more detailed consideration. In one
scenario, the sexbot acts as a brittle star. Multi-limbed and
star-shaped, this living, breathing and mutating deep-sea animal offers
us an opportunity to rethink normative relationships and connectivities.
The brittle star is a body whose morphology, namely its intertwined
skeletal and diffuse nervous systems, constitutes a system for
visualization, since its epidermis consists entirely of microlenses. As
an animal without a brain, being and knowing, materiality and
intelligibility, substance and form collapse into one another. When at
risk of capture, a brittle star breaks off the threatened body part and
then regrows it. During this process, it regenerates and autonomizes its
optics and other sensualities, continually reworking its geometry,
topology, and bodily boundaries. Its corporeality, materially enacted,
is not a matter of being specifically situated *in* the world, but
rather of being *of* the world in all its dynamic specificity.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_9]

Likewise, brittle star species exhibit great diversity in sexual
behavior and reproduction, be this broadcast spawning or sexual
dimorphism, to take just two examples. Some are hermaphroditic and
self-fertilizing, while others reproduce asexually by regenerating or
cloning themselves from fragmented body parts.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_10]

Brittle stars are living nanotechnology. Their technical and sensual
morphology, which allows them to respire and to repair themselves, is
now being used as a blueprint for enterprises such as new software and
computing operations, and designs in the fields of logistics and life
sciences, as well as telecommunications, optical networks, and
artificial pleasure machines aimed at chemosensory experience.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_11] The
question now is not only how these queer, nonhuman animals can be
appropriated for political human and technical interests, which give
shape to life-forms of unknown, aleatory orientations, but also how our
desires are being co-constitutively reconfigured. In the video, the
sexbot’s intimacies are computed as diffraction patterns. But beyond
potential computer software applications, our attunement to brittle star
intra-action matters most in queering our understanding of and
participation in networked realities and technological transformation,
moving toward entangled forms of intra-participation.

![Fig. 3: Molecular Sex (still), Johanna Bruckner, 2020. 4K Video.](imgs/10.3.jpg)

<br/>

In the other scenario, the bot performs as and in relation to the
Wolbachia bacterium. These hardy bacteria exist and make love in ways
that are not to be disrupted by climate change or even nuclear war. Love
among Wolbachia bacteria often develops in the form of temporary
alliances and symbiotic attachments, connections that establish
themselves like a rhizome between the different target bodies of various
species, regardless of their sex. Wolbachia’s queer kinship practices
evolve by becoming molecular in swarms of multiplicities, with elements
of the bodies crossing over into and transgressing others. Wolbachia
trade genes with different species, blurring the boundaries between self
and other. They sterilize the unsuspecting sexual partners of their
invertebrate hosts to bring about reproductive isolation and the
conditions for new speciation. They can perform gender-bending practices
in host bodies, for example transforming genetic males into
reproductively viable females by altering the sperm cytoplasm, that is
to say the material semiotic fluid within the cell. The sperm of males
infected with Wolbachia become weaponized, turning into what I
previously referred to as a ‘smart bomb’. To affirm the conditions of
speciation, these sperm destroy the eggs of uninfected females, moving
toward new cross-species of aleatory sexual entities. As
micro-biopolitical agents, these bacteria disorganize the bodies of
their hosts on a molecular level. Within this context, biomedical
initiatives have reinforced biopolitical strategies, exploring potential
human/microbe collaborations for future technological concerns in the
field of social and economic equalities.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_12]

In a further scenario, the emerging sexbotic figurations in the video
interact with an intersex person. Instead of simple sex chromosome data
– usually XX or XY – in the future there would be dozens of sex-related
genes. Molecular genetics is therefore likely to require a shift from
binary sex to quantum sex, with a dozen or more genes each conferring a
small probability of male or female sex; their further emergence and
design would depend on micro- and macro-environmental interactions. The
forms of sexes and sexualities that might emerge from this quantum cloud
of biological and environmental progress are still speculative.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_13]

## III.

In order to better understand the corporeality of technology, matter,
and desire that underpin this text, let me briefly consider Karen
Barad’s examinations of quantum field theory. Barad describes the
inseparability of the world and object as ‘intra-action’, and conceives
of reality as a continuum of intra-acting quantum entanglements.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_14]
She proposes that matter is ‘characterized by self-touch – by the
interaction of the particle with the surrounding electromagnetic field
or virtual particles, which it itself generates and destroys – and in
which it “comes into contact with the infinite alterity that it itself
is.”’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_15] Touching and experiencing are thus regarded as the essence of
what constitutes matter. This concept of matter always includes
alterities – the virtual, the unpredictable – and requires ‘recognition
of our responsibility towards the infinity of the other.’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_16] In this
regard, the sensible is in continuous intra-action with itself and, as
such, queers, disorders, and preempts affections and the affective
machine. This understanding of the indeterminacy of the machine and the
self as multiplicity is for Barad a ‘superposition – an intensification
of matter beyond an ordering regime.’ In order to understand matter’s
micro-agencies, Barad introduces the concept of ‘agential
separability’.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_17] Materials differentiate in conjunction with
affective forces, maintaining the object-human relation in a process of
perpetual diffraction and refraction. Agential separability, the
agentially enacted material condition of phenomena, is what shapes and
reshapes matter from within. In any given situation, there are
micro-agencies on the tiniest of scales within the object-human
relation, which, when intensified on a larger scale, lead to
micro-revolutionary crystallizations.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_18] Following Barad, we could
consider these radical molecular crystallizations happening among
particles of matter on a molecular level as ‘phenomena \[that\] are not
located in space or time, but are material entanglements enfolded and
threaded through the spacetimemattering of the universe.’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_19] Plastics
do not biodegrade; they break apart, becoming smaller and smaller but
remaining integral to themselves while affecting the world. These
agential cuts, the micro-revolutionary formations, enact the
possibilities of situational responses, which indeed produce the
capability for responsibilities in each individual constellation of
particles. A micro-revolutionary practice thus presupposes plural acts
of becoming responsible/response-abilities. Matter, or to be more
precise, our relation to our affective machines and substances,
crystallizes a ‘densification of the ability to react, to
respond.’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_20] 

In more general terms, bodies and their social relations are structured
by pre-symbolic or nonhuman forces – forces that are constructed as
competing micro-agencies. These subjects are bodies of multiplicities,
as they are diffracted across space, time, and realities. Their
embodiment is their situational embedment in the environment as well as
their interaction with it, as an embodied cognition.

<br/>

The installation considers the possibility of a futurity in which
becoming one with animals and techno-objects is a collective
participation in preternatural agency. Today’s sensate technoid body – a
body in which the boundaries between human and machine are always
already displaced, and which includes sexbots and their artificial
intelligences – can be perceived as ‘a matter of material imploded
entities, a body as dense material semiotic things; in between and not
able to locate.’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_21] However, the point of this cyborg doll then is not
to blur the boundaries between human and nonhuman, but rather to
understand the materializing effects of particular ways of drawing
boundaries between ‘humans’ and ‘non-humans’.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_22] Their state of
indeterminacy is inherent to the formation of new temporalities and
spheres of desire, in which new subjects of entanglement come into
being.

## IV. 

Even if the molecular is exploited as raw material, it may yet be an
available resource for resistance. The brittle star, Wolbachia, and the
plastification of the world provide examples in which the revolutionary
immediacy of molecular agency can be observed as intrinsic to the
non/human domain of cells and bodies. From observations of cellular
behavior, a cell’s metabolic networks, meshworks, and protein folding
seem to be speculative materially enacted processes, since they do not
exist beyond their relation to matter, which is, for Barad, an aleatory,
agential process. What is more, the regime of financial valorization
through biosecurity is in an unstable state of affairs, as it is almost
impossible to invent an unspecifiable futurity within the molecular
realm of economic calculation. In Barad’s approaches to matter’s
capacity for intrinsic micro-agencies, the virtual is incalculable.
Rather, the multitude of molecular bodily materials, as sensible
relationalities, provide space for the proliferation of alternative body
knowledge, for the emergence of new demands for state and corporate
bodies, through the collectivization of semiotic-sensible minds. As for
today’s cognitive workers, the biological self is a precariously bare
entity. Of central importance are the sub-ontological zones, in which
confrontation and struggle take place outside the field of the
recognizable and so beyond representation itself. For example, practices
of alignment via molecular processes of undercommoning posit the world
as yet to come, with the present held as an open field for political
engagement.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_23] This molecular territorialization can now refer not
just to chemical and genetic processes but also to human bodies,
political groupings, and assemblages: ‘molecules territorialize and
deterritorialize by creating ever-new groupings and then branch off into
other possibilities’ of human, social, and abstract connectivities.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_24]
The molecular temporalities that emerge, speculatively considered,
generate a discontinuous history and present of their own.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_25] Matter’s
ongoing constitution of the sensible as a series of molecular,
intra-active patterns represents queer ecologies because, in their
inherently resistant nature and through their aleatory figuration, the
molecular becomes an abstraction. These molecules of desire become the
occasion for polymorphic anticipation and embodied micro-agencies of the
sensible. This process of disaffected labor, through which molecules
create, cut, separate, and re-entangle their agencies, is itself an
assemblage of micro-revolutionary crystallization, whose
intensifications conceive of techno-human bodies as complex ‘particles
of possibility’.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_26] Our technological machines constitute us in
relation to the matter that surrounds us. The politics of desire
essentially concern these assemblages of ‘particles of possibility’
constituted by abstract machines.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_27]

## V.

To conclude, the sexbot proposed in my work aims to bring to the surface
the underlying micro-agencies that are enhanced in the techno-affective
machinic relationship between body, desire, and matter and which
constitute the multitude of precarious bodies whose ‘molecular joy’
represents the raw material of intimate-cognitive capitalism. In doing
so, this work proposes that we urgently refine our cyborg politics,
taking ‘pleasure in the confusion of boundaries’ and making arguments
‘for responsibility in their construction.’[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_28]

The integration of artificial intelligence into sexbots stores
information in the bot’s body, through which it learns to perform as an
aleatory, molecular intra-participatory sexual species. This code and
the bot’s subsequent actions are based on training, which makes
modifications in intra-action with its environment. This training is
based on data sets, which intra-actively generate data-scapes of
pleasure, and which are again linked to and placed within the existing
infrastructures of computing, while also redefining access and
connection within computing. Rather than encouraging data’s permanence,
these emerging intra-active data-scapes promote polygamy, polymorphism,
and randomness. The code opens up networks of as-yet unknown sensual,
affective knowledge: an eternal nexus of feedback within the sym-poetic
entanglement between body, sex, and technology, toward a polyrhythmic
cyberspace. As a micropolitical virus, the physical and artificial body
infiltrate the configuration and performance of other technical machines
and their relations. Its agency should be recognized not only by its
appearance as virtual pleasure, but by its ability to redistribute and
contest the processes of transmission, streaming, downloading, storage,
sharing, and consumption.

My starting principle for this work was the notion that the conceptions
of bodies and realities proposed by artificial intelligence and such new
technologies are deeply rooted in heteronormative, racist, colonial
worldviews: we need to unsettle the determination of, access to, and our
participation in these scenarios. Humanity must actively intervene in
the disorder of biological life on all scales, in order to produce
temporalities of collectively desired entanglement. What might be
learned from plastics in creating political resiliency in the face of
accelerating forms of biological, climatic, geologic, social, and
technological change, death, and disparity? As a result of their
molecular base in oil, plastics accumulate toxic potency as they move
through the world and our molecular bodies.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_29] It seems to me that
humanity’s most pressing requirement is a political order that
corresponds to the corporeal techno-scientific practices; one that is
not constrained by law, property, and nation, but is open to an ethical
play beyond the current appropriation of life into the geopolitical
biological apparatus. In maintaining refuges and spaces for
undisciplined, wild, and unruly forms of life and knowledge, homes for
inverts and techno-queer microbes and life-forms should be included
too.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_30] We need to be prepared to accept unlikely allies, recognizing
that our struggles are mutual, or at least directed against common
enemies: the increasing liberation of markets, austerity measures, and
extractivism. The ethics of the present essentially involve finding
strategies for living with toxicity, indeed accepting it as a queer
future; ways of navigating horror while resisting the policies,
governments, and corporations blocking new and alien life-forms from
emerging.[^10BrucknerMolecularSexandPolymorphicSensibilities_31] In fact, no economy of technology-led transformations in
polymorphic desires, sex-related affinities, and reproductive labor yet
exists. The onus is on us to create systems in which future libidinal
orders can find a place to affirm non/human networks as undercommoning
affinities and joint temporalities.
