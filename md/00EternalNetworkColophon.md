The Berlin-based transmediale festival publishes content related to its
program in its online journal, of which this collection is an extension,
published with the Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam. This
edition is realized in the framework of transmediale 2020 *End to End*
and its exhibition ‘The Eternal Network’, which takes place at Haus der
Kulturen der Welt from 28 January – 1 March 2020. The exhibition is
curated by Kristoffer Gansing with the advice of Clemens Apprich, Daphne
Dragona, Geert Lovink, and Florian Wüst.

transmediale wishes to thank Geert Lovink and INC for their
collaboration, and Miriam Rasch (INC) and Tabea Hamperl (transmediale)
for the coordination of the overall project; Inga Luchs for her great
co-editing, Hannah Gregory and Rebecca Bligh
for their thorough copy-editing, and Jen Theodor for her patient work on
the German translation. A heartfelt thanks goes out to all the authors
who contributed to this volume.

transmediale has been funded as a cultural institution of excellence by
Kulturstiftung des Bundes since 2004. For the wide range of supporters
