    <Content> the desire to build alternatives has grown stronger. This has manifested through the emergence of a wide range of projects, driven by various motives. These projects introduce themselves by emphasizing what makes them distinct from corporate social media, whether it is their ethics, their organizational structure, their underlying technologies, their features, their source code access, or the special interest communities they seek to support. Although diverse, these platforms tend to have one common purpose: to directly question the vendor lock-in of the dominant social media landscape. As a result, they call for different levels of decentralization and interoperability in terms of network architectures and data circulation.

Power and responsibility are distributed as they do so. In the context of social media, federated networks exist as different communities on different servers that can interoperate with each other, rather than existing as a single software or single platform. This idea is not new, but it has recently gained traction and revitalized efforts toward building alternative social media.</Content>

    <Content> alternatives to existing closed source and proprietary software. As such, these projects were originally promoted as similar in function to the corporate platforms but made with FLOSS. As they were mostly articulated around the openness of protocols and source code, these software platforms catered to a limited audience of users and software developers, who were largely concerned with issues typical of FLOSS culture. This lack of reach changed in 2016 with the introduction of Mastodon, a combination of client and server software for federated social media. Mastodon was quickly adopted by a diverse community of users, including many people usually under-represented in FLOSS: women, people of color, and queer-identifying people. Upon joining Mastodon, these less-represented communities questioned the social dynamics of existing FLOSS environments, as well as started to contribute both code and critique, which challenged the dominant one-size-fits-all narrative of corporate social media. It is no coincidence that this shift happened in the wake of Gamergate</Content>

Second, a wider willingness to recover agency as users of social media infrastructures.

They want to contribute to network infrastructures that are more honest about their underlying ideologies. These infrastructures do not hide behind manipulative or delusional exploits of ideas like openness, universal access, or apolitical engineering. Although today it is too early to tell whether or not the Fediverse will live up to the expectations of its inhabitants, and how it will impact FLOSS in the long run, it is already possible to map current transformations, as well as the challenges faced in this latest episode of the never-ending saga of net and computational culture. To do so, we present seven theses on the Fediverse and the becoming of FLOSS, in the hope of opening up discussions around some of their most pressing issues.</Content>

    <Content>Social media platforms have taken the democratization of meme production and circulation to a previously unseen scale. Moreover, these platforms have grown in symbiosis with internet meme culture. Corporate social media platforms have been optimized and engineered to favor material with memetic qualities. This material encourages reaction and recirculation and is part of a strategy of user retention and participation in surveillance capitalism. Consequently, in the environments used today for the vast majority of online communication, almost everything has become a meme, or needs to exhibit memetic properties to survive – or be visible – in the universe of algorithmic timelines and feeds informed by metrics.</Content>

    <Content>Given that social media is geared toward communication and interaction, what was completely underestimated was how memes would become far more than either strategically engineered vessels to plant ideas, or funny viral things to share with peers. They became a language, a slang, a collection of signs and symbols through which cultural and subcultural identity could materialize. The circulation of such memes has in turn strengthened certain political discourses, which has become a growing concern for the platforms. Indeed, to maximize the exploitation of their user activity, corporate social media platforms must find the right balance between laissez-faire and regulation. They try to do so by means of algorithmic filtering, community feedback, and terms of services. The corporate platforms are increasingly faced, however, with the fact that they have created Petri dishes for all sorts of opinions and beliefs to circulate out of control, in spite of their efforts to reduce and shape discursive, user-generated content toward inoffensive, business-friendly, and otherwise trivial material. Regardless of what these platforms pretend in PR campaigns or hearings in front of legislators, it is clear that no amount of tech solutionism and no amount of outsourced precarious work by traumatised human moderators</Content>

    <Content>Corporate social media platforms have decided to cut anything that could endanger their business, while remaining ambivalent about their claim of neutrality. But unlike the radical exodus and software-writing exile of some communities, the Fediverse offers instead a vast system in which communities can be independent while still interfacing with others over several servers. In a situation where either censorship or isolated exodus were the only options, federation opens a third way. It allows a community to engage with exchanges or have conflicts with other platforms while remaining true to its own scope, ideology, and interests. From here, two new scenarios are possible: One, where a localized online culture could be established and appropriated as part of the circulation of discourse within a shared communication network. Two: where radicalized memetic material would likely favor the emergence of thinking along axes of friends and enemies spread across instances, to the extent that simplistic meme wars and propaganda would be replaced with network wars.</Content>

    <Content>The concepts of openness, universality, and the free circulation of information have been central narratives for promoting technological progress and growth on the internet and the web. While these narratives have been instrumental in advocating FLOSS and free culture, they have also been crucial in the development of social media, where the goal was to create ever-growing networks, encompassing evermore people, freely communicating with one another. Following liberal traditions, this approach was believed to favor productive exchanges of opinions by providing ample space for free speech, access to more information, and the possibility for anyone to participate. However, these open systems were also open to capture by the market and exposed to the predatory culture of corporations. In the case of the web, this has led to business models that make use of both the structures and the content circulating across the network.</Content>

    <Content>Historically, alternative social media projects such as GNU Social, and more precisely Identi.ca/StatusNet, sought to salvage this situation by creating platforms that tackled this particular form of well-marketed openness. They created interoperating systems explicitly opposed to advertising and tracking. In doing so, they hoped to prove that it is still possible to have an ever-growing network while distributing responsibility over the ownership of data, and in theory to provide the means for various communities to appropriate the platforms’ source code and contribute to protocol design. This was pretty much the shared belief in the Fediverse around 2016. This belief remained unchallenged because the Fediverse at the time had not changed much from its early days as a FLOSS social media federation project, started more than a decade before. Consequently, it was made up of a largely homogenous crowd, whose interests intersected technology, FLOSS, and anti-corporate ideologies. However, as the Fediverse’s population grew more diverse when Mastodon attracted more heterogeneous communities, conflicts emerged between these different communities. This time it was the Fediverse’s own idea of openness that was increasingly challenged by the newcomers. As part of this critique, a call emerged within the user community of Mastodon for the ability to block or ‘defederate’ with other servers in the Fediverse. Blocking means that users or administrators of servers could choose to prevent content from other servers in the network from reaching them. ‘Defederation’ in this sense became an additional option in the toolkit for strong community-based moderation, since it prevented confrontation with unwanted or harmful content.</Content>

    <Content> In this view, the bigger and more interconnected the network could become, the more successful it might be as an alternative to corporate social media. Similarly, many saw blocking as limiting the possibilities for personal expression and the productive exchange of ideas, fearing filter bubbles and isolation as a consequence. By striving for selected disconnection and challenging the very idea that online discourse is necessarily generative, the communities advocating for defederation also challenged the broader liberal assumptions about openness and universality on which prior Fediverse software was built.</Content>

    <Content>The fact that concurrently to these developments, the Fediverse grew from 200,000 to over 3.5 million accounts, at the time of writing, is unlikely to be a coincidence. Rather than thwarting the network, defederation, self-governing communities, and the rejection of universality allowed the Fediverse to accommodate even more communities. The presence of different servers representing very distinct communities that each have their local culture and agency over their own slice of the network, without being isolated from the larger whole, is one of the more interesting aspects of the Fediverse. However, almost one million of the total number of accounts are the result of the alt-right platform Gab switching to the Fediverse protocols, which shows that the network is still open to capture or domination by a single large party.</Content>

    <Content> At the same time, this development immediately triggered a variety of efforts to strengthen the possibilities for servers to deal with this risk of domination. For example, the possibility for some server implementations to federate based on white lists, which allows servers to interconnect on an opt-in rather than opt-out basis. Another proposed response is to extend ActivityPub, one of the most popular and most discussed protocols of the Fediverse, with stronger authorization methods based on an object-capability model of computer security, allowing parties to retroactively withdraw consent from other parties to see or use their data. What is unique about the Fediverse is this both technical and cultural acknowledgement that openness has its limits, and is itself open to wide-ranging interpretations dependent on context, which are not fixed in time. This is a fundamentally new point of departure for reimagining social media today.</Content>

    <Content>As we have established, one of the most important traits of the Fediverse is that the different software stacks and applications that constitute it can be hosted by virtually anyone and for any purpose. This means that it is possible to create an online community that can interface with the rest of the Fediverse but that operates according to its own local rules, guidelines, modes of organization, and ideology. In this process, each community is able to define itself not only through its own memetic language, interests, and scope, but also in relation to the other, via difference. Such specificity might make the Fediverse seem like an infrastructural assemblage that follows the principles of agonistic pluralism. Agonistic pluralism, or agonism, was first articulated by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, who then further developed this political theory. In Mouffe’s view, political consensus is impossible and radical negativity cannot be avoided in a system where diversity is limited to similar competing groups within the same hegemonic order.</Content>

    <Content>The bet made by agonism is that by creating a system in which a pluralism of hegemonies is permitted, it is possible to move from an understanding of the other as an enemy, to the other as a political adversary. For this to happen, different ideologies must be allowed to materialize via different channels and platforms. An important prerequisite is that the goal of political consensus must be abandoned and replaced with conflictual consensus, in which an acknowledgement of the other becomes the foundational building block of new relationships, even if this means, for example, accepting non-Western views on democracy, secularism, communities, and the individual. Translated to the Fediverse, it is clear that it already contains a relatively diverse political landscape and that transitions from political consensus to conflictual consensus can be witnessed in the way communities relate to one another. At the base of these conflictual exchanges are various points of view on the collective design and use of the software stack and the underlying protocols that would be needed to further enable a sort of online agonistic pluralism.</Content>

The Fediverse’s idea of a system in which different communities can find a place for themselves amongst others was concretely put to the test in July 2019, when the explicitly alt-right platform Gab announced it would change its code base, moving away from its proprietary system to instead rely on Mastodon’s source code. As a project that explicitly takes a stance against the ideology of Gab, Mastodon was confronted with the neutrality of FLOSS licenses. Other Fediverse projects such as mobile phone clients FediLab and Tusky were also faced with the same issue; perhaps even more so, because the direct motivation for Gab’s developers to switch to Fediverse software was to circumvent their ban from the Apple and Google app stores for violating their terms of service. By relying on generic FLOSS Fediverse clients, Gab would be able to escape such bans in the future, and also forge alliances with other ideologically compatible instances on the Fediverse.</Content>

This latter question has created a complicated back-and-forth where some instances will demand other instances to explicitly take part in a conflict, by blocking specific other instances in order to avoid being blocked themselves. Neutrality, whether driven by ambivalence, unspoken support, hypocrisy, the desire to troll, a lack of interest, faith in apolitical technology, or by an agonistic desire to engage with all sides so as to reach a state of conflictual consensus, is very difficult to achieve. The Fediverse is the closest environment we currently have to a diverse global network of local singularities. However, its complex topology and struggle to deal with the infamous paradox of tolerance – what to do about the idea of free speech – shows the difficulty of reaching a state of conflictual consensus. It also demonstrates the challenge of translating a theory of agonism into a shared strategy for the design of protocols, software, and community guidelines. Tolerance and free speech have become volatile topics after nearly two decades of political manipulation and filtering within corporate social media; seeing how popular imageboards and discussion forums have failed to solve these issues does not make for a hopeful outlook for future experimentation.</Content>

    <Content>Rather than reaching a state of agonistic pluralism, it could be that the Fediverse will create at best a form of bastard agonism through pillarization. That is to say, we could witness a situation in which instances would form large agonistic-without-agonism aggregations only among both ideologically and technically compatible communities and software, with only a minority of them able and willing to bridge with radically opposed systems. Regardless of the outcome, this question of agonism and of politics in general is crucial for net and computational culture. In the context of Western post-political systems and the way these are translated to the net, a sense of loss of political partisanship and agency has given the illusion, or delusion, that there is no longer a political compass. If the Fediverse teaches us anything, it is that the net and the FLOSS components of its infrastructure have never been more politicized than today. The politics that are generated and hosted on the Fediverse are not trivial but they are clearly articulated. What’s more, as demonstrated by the proliferation of social media political celebrities and politicians actively using social media, a new form of representative democracy is emerging, in which the memetic language of post-digital cultures are effectively translated into the world of electoral politics and back.</Content>

    <Content>In the past, debates around the risks of corporate social media have focused on the issues of privacy and surveillance, especially since the Snowden revelations in 2013.

This means that rather than focusing on technical features such as peer-to-peer topologies and end-to-end encryption, development has been centered around building robust moderation tools, granular visibility settings for posts, and the possibility to block other instances.</Content>

    <Content>So while everyone has a stake in considering the privacy implications that come from (involuntary) associations between online accounts, for example between an employer and an employee, marginalized communities are disproportionately impacted by such forms of surveillance and their consequences. As the development of newer Fediverse platforms such as Mastodon got underway, with members of such communities helping to build them, these issues were put on the agenda of software development roadmaps. All of a sudden, tools that were used to track and discuss technical defects during the development of FLOSS also became a discursive venue for social, cultural, and political issues. We will return to this point in section six.</Content>

    <Content>The techniques that were eventually developed included server-wide blocks, advanced moderation tools, content warnings, and improved accessibility. This allowed for geographically, culturally, and ideologically disparate communities to share the same network on their own terms. As such, the Fediverse can be understood as different communities that rally around a server, or instance, so as to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable. Again, this represents a third way: neither the model of privacy where technically inclined individuals are in full command of their own communications, nor the model whereby the multitude believes they have ‘nothing to hide’ simply because they have no say nor control over the systems they depend on. In effect, the move to a social understanding of privacy has shown that the Fediverse is now a working laboratory in which questions of social organization and governance can no longer pretend to be decoupled from software.</Content>

    <Content>What matters is that the Fediverse represents a shift from defining the issues of surveillance and privacy as technical problems to defining them as social ones. However, the focus on social aspects of privacy has so far resulted in placing a lot of trust in other servers and administrators to act respectfully. This can be problematic, as for example direct messages, with their implied privacy, would be far better managed with technical solutions such as end-to-end encryption. Further, many of the solutions sought in Fediverse software development seem to be based on the collective rather than on the individual. This is not to say that technical security considerations are of no concern at all. Fediverse servers tend to come with ‘privacy by default’ settings, such as required transport encryption and the proxying of remote queries in order not to expose individual users. Still, this shift to a social understanding of privacy remains young, and the discussion must continue at many other levels.</Content>

    <Content>So far regulating these products and services has been extremely difficult, in part because of effective lobbying from the platform owners and shareholders, but also, perhaps more importantly, because of the derivative nature of the monetization that takes place inside corporate social media. What is capitalized by these platforms is an algorithmic by-product, crude or not, of the activity and data uploaded by its users. This creates a distance that makes it ever-harder to grasp the relationship between online labor, user-generated content, tracking, and monetization. This distance effectively works in two ways. First, it obfuscates the exact mechanics at play, making it harder to regulate data capture and analysis. It allows for situations where these platforms can develop products that they can benefit from while still complying with privacy laws from different jurisdictions, and therefore promote their service as privacy friendly. The latter is often reinforced by giving their users all sorts of options to mislead them into believing they are in control of what they feed the machine. Second, by making it seem that no personally identifiable data is directly used for monetization; these platforms are hiding the economic transaction behind other types of transactions, such as personal interactions between users, professional opportunities, online community-managed groups and discussions, and so on. In the end, users are unable to make a connection between their social or professional activity and its exploitation because it is all derivative of other transactions that have become essential in our ever-connected lives, especially in the age of entreprecariat</Content>

    <Content>Yet regardless of how the community of an instance is organized, empowered, and actively participating in the platform and network – not to mention the fact that getting into coding is easier said than done – more control over data is not guaranteed. It is still possible to easily scrape or collect information from these platforms, possibly even more so than from corporate social networks since commercial services actively prevent others from exploiting their data silo. At present, it is quite simple to crawl the Fediverse and profile its users. Even though most Fediverse platforms are themselves against user tracking and data sharecropping, third parties can do so anyway because the Fediverse operates as an open network primarily designed for public posts. Additionally, as certain interests, notably political discussions, tend to be concentrated on specific servers, activist communities may be more readily exposed to intelligence. So while the Fediverse helps users to understand, or be reminded, that whatever is published online can and will escape their control, it cannot prevent all the habits and false sense of online security inherited from corporate social media from going on, after nearly two decades of digital privacy misinformation.</Content>

    <Content> These attempts to compensate labor are a good step, however making them more widespread, and maintaining such projects in the long run, will require more structural support. Without substantial funding for ongoing development and maintenance, these projects will remain contingent upon the exploitation of the free labor of well-meaning individuals, or subject to the whims of people making time for their FLOSS hobby. At the same time there is increasing acknowledgement and precedent that much of FLOSS can be considered public utility goods, which should be funded from public sources.</Content>

    <Content>Finally, in some cases, non-technical tasks like moderation are remunerated by Fediverse communities. This raises the question of why some kinds of labor are compensated, and others not, if there is compensation at all. What about the vital early work of care and critique by members of marginalized communities in voicing how Fediverse projects should address a social understanding of privacy, for example? Without a doubt it was this work that enabled the Fediverse to reach the user base it has today. Then how can such work be measured? It happens in and throughout the network, in meta-discussion threads, or on issue trackers, which is not as quantifiable nor visible as code commits. So while there are some interesting shifts happening, it remains to be seen whether users and developers on the Fediverse can be made fully aware of these issues, and if economic models outside of surveillance capitalism can thrive to support non-exploitative solidarity and care across the whole stack.</Content>

    <Content>One way to understand the Fediverse is as a signifier of a set of practices, or rather a set of expectations and demands about social media software, in which the disparate efforts of alternative social media projects converge into a shared network with roughly aligned goals. Diverse models of usership, shared between servers, range from venture-capital-backed alt-right platforms to Japanese imageboard systems, anarcho-communist collectives, political factions, live-coding algoravers, ‘safe spaces’ for sex workers, gardening forums, personal blogs, and self-hosting cooperatives. These practices happen in parallel with the problem of data sharecropping and free labor, and represent part of the ongoing transformation of what it entails to be a software user.</Content>

It is this situation that helped shape much of the growing popularity of FLOSS in the 90s, as an adversary of proprietary commercial operating systems for personal computers, specifically reinforcing earlier concepts of users’ freedom.</Content>

    <Content> With the advent of Web 2.0, the situation changed again. Because of the communicative and ubiquitous dimension of the software behind corporate social media platforms, vendors have begun to offer a small window of opportunity to their users to give feedback, as a way to make their product more engaging and relevant to everyday activities. Users can usually easily report bugs, suggest new features, or help shape the platforms’ culture through the conversations they have and content they share. Twitter is a well-known example of this, where core features such as the ‘@’ usernames and the ‘#’ hashtags were first suggested by users. Forums like Reddit also allow users to set up and moderate boards, creating distinct and specific communities.</Content>

    <Content>On alternative social media platforms like the Fediverse, particularly in its early days, these forms of participation move a step further. Users do not only engage in bug reporting, or help with the creation of the products’ culture, they also become involved with scrutinizing the code, debating its effects, and even contributing code back. As the Fediverse grows in size and encompasses a greater diversity of cultures and software stacks, the behaviors of this usership are becoming even more comprehensive. People set up additional nodes in the network and work on the development of tailored codes of conducts and terms of services that aid the enforcement of community guidelines for that node. They also consider how to make these efforts sustainable through funding via the community.</Content>

    <Content>This said, not all requests for change, including fully functional code contributions, are accepted by the main developers of the platforms. This is in part because the larger Fediverse platforms believe in well-considered default settings that work for diverse majorities, rather than the old archetypical model of FLOSS, to provide extensive customization and intricate options that appeal to programmers, but discourage many others. Thanks to the availability of source code, a rich ecosystem of modified versions of projects nevertheless exists, to extend, or limit, certain features while retaining a degree of compatibility with the wider network. Debates over the merits of features and the modified software they generate foster further discussion over the direction of such projects, which in turn leads to increased attention around their governance.</Content>

The way service facilitators are supported on the Fediverse, for example, is analogous to the way in which content creators on streaming platforms in gaming communities are supported by their audience. Calls for better governance of software projects are also ongoing in FLOSS communities more widely. The development of codes of conduct (a key document for Fediverse instances to lay out their vision of their community and politics) was introduced in various FLOSS communities in the early 2010s, in response to systematic misogyny and the exclusion of minorities from FLOSS spaces both on- and offline.</Content>

    <Content> Whether motivated by ethics or economics, both free software and open source software share the ideal that their position is superior to closed source and proprietary modes of production. However in both cases, the foundational liberal drive at the base of these ethical and economic perspectives is rarely challenged. This drive is deeply rooted in a Western context that over the past few decades has favored individual freedom in the form of liberalism and libertarianism at the expense of equality and care. Questioning this drive is a pivotal step, as this would open up discussions about other ways to approach the writing and circulation of, and access to, source code. By extension this would stop the pretension that these practices are either apolitical, universal, or neutral. Unfortunately, such discussions have been difficult to facilitate for reasons that go beyond the dogmatic nature of both free and open source software agendas. In fact they have been inconceivable because one of the most important aspects of FLOSS is that it was conceived as non-discriminatory in nature. To be sure, with non-discriminatory, we refer to FLOSS licensing, that permits anyone to make use of a FLOSS source code for any purpose.</Content>

To make things worse, the main concern of FLOSS advocacy has historically been about widespread adoption in administration, education, professional, and commercial environments, and depoliticization was seen to be key to achieving this goal.

    <Content>First, the rise of this new kind of usership meant a new questioning of the archetypal models of governance of FLOSS projects, such as the benevolent dictator. Consequently, several long-standing FLOSS projects have been pressured to adopt accountability structures and migrate to community-oriented forms of governance such as co-ops or associations. Second, licenses now tend to be combined with other textual documents like copyright transfer agreements, terms of services, and codes of conduct. These documents are used to shape the community, make their ideological alignment clearer, and try to prevent manipulation and misunderstanding around vague notions like openness, transparency, and freedom. Third, the strong political coloring of source code challenges the existing understanding of FLOSS. As previously mentioned, some of these efforts are driven by the desire to avoid the censorship and control of corporate social media platforms, while others explicitly seek to develop software for anti-fascist use. These efforts not only dispute the universality and global usefulness of large, general social media platforms, they also interrogate the supposed universality and neutrality of software. This is particularly true when software comes with politically explicit complementary terms, codes, and agreements for their users and developers to accept.</Content>

    <Content>With its relatively diverse constituency of users, developers, agenda, software, and ideologies, the Fediverse is gradually becoming the most relevant system for the articulation of new forms of FLOSS critique. The Fediverse has become a site where traditional notions about FLOSS are confronted and revised by people who understand its use as part of a wider set of practices that challenge the status quo. Sometimes this happens in a reflective, discursive way across several communities, sometimes through the materialization of experiments and projects that directly challenge FLOSS as we know it. It has become the sprawling site where constructive critiques of FLOSS and a longing for its reimagination are most vivid. In its current state, FLOSS culture feels like a patched-up collection of irreconcilable pieces from another era, and it is urgent to revaluate many of its characteristics that have been taken for granted. If we can accept the much-needed sacrilege of thinking of free software without free software, it remains to be seen what could fill the void left by its absence.</Content>
