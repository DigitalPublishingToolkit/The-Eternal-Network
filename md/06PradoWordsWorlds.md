# There Are Words and Worlds That Are Truthful and True

### Luiza Prado de O. Martins

## A Red Path, A Black Sky

On August 23, 2019, an accident took place in the Rodovia Presidente
Dutra, one of Rio de Janeiro’s most important federal highways. In a
section that cuts through the suburban municipality of Nova Iguaçu, a
cargo truck carrying pesticide was hit by another vehicle. Vats rolled
out of the truck, spilling their contents all along the highway, a
bright pinkish-red liquid, dragged along the pavement by the wheels of
other cars for hundreds of meters. The highway was temporarily closed as
the liquid, considered harmful to humans, was cleaned up. RJTV, the
region’s most popular midday news program, aired footage of workers in
hazmat suits shoveling the dried remains of the substance into large
white bags under the cheerful headline ‘Colorful Dutra’.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_1] The exact
nature of the pesticide, as well as the name of the company or companies
responsible for its manufacturing and transportation, went unmentioned.
The ensuing traffic jams slowed the flow of vehicles from city center to
periphery for kilometers.

Four days earlier, around 3 p.m. on August 19, 2019, day abruptly turned
into darkness in São Paulo. The skies above the metropolis, so often
obscured by rainy clouds, acquired an unusual, black-brown hue; a sooty
curtain falling prematurely over the city’s bewildered inhabitants.
Later that afternoon, the thick clouds finally released their cargo – a
deep black rain, heavy with the unexpected scent of smoke.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_2] The
reason for this dark rain did not take much guessing: the fires
devouring the Amazon rainforest along Brazil’s northernmost states had
been in the news for a while. This was just one repercussion, finally
reaching the country’s largest and wealthiest city, pushed by a cold
wind. São Paulo’s Tietê River – once a clean, living body of water – had
long ago been reduced to a sludgy, foul-smelling mass; now it was the
turn of the skies to fall.

Rainforests don’t burn spontaneously; they must be intentionally set on
fire. In July 2019, INPE (Brazil’s National Institute for Space
Research) reported an 88 percent increase in wildfires in the Amazon
basin, compared to the same time frame in the previous year.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_3] For
centuries before this summer, forests had covered a great portion of the
tropical areas of South America. The fires that preceded the black rain,
the premature nightfall, and the spillage of pesticides had, in truth,
been consuming everything in their path since European ships first
arrived on the shores of the continent. These events were part of an old
tragedy, a long-festering wound. To consume, to devour until nothing is
left – these practices are interwoven throughout the history of
coloniality into the present, from the foodstuffs taken from the
Americas to be served to eager Europeans, to the voracious consumption
of living black and brown bodies at the table of colonial economy, to
the ravenous devouring of the Earth itself in the quest for endless
economic growth. Avidity, in short, which leads inevitably to
destruction; rapacity, which hinges on a vastly unequal distribution of
the conditions necessary for well-being.

It is this hunger that underscores the rhetoric of exploitation of human
and nonhuman beings at the root of the current climate crisis; a hunger
that classifies not only forests, valleys, lakes, and seas, but also
some people, as ‘resources’. In his book *Ideias para adiar o fim do
mundo* (Ideas to Postpone the End of the World), Indigenous writer and
activist Ailton Krenak remarks that ‘\[w\]hen we remove the personhood
from the river, the mountain, when we remove their senses, thinking that
this is an exclusively human attribute, we allow these places to become
residues of extractivist industrial activity.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_4] He points out: ‘If
there is an eagerness to consume nature, there is also one to consume
subjectivities – our subjectivities.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_5] While some continue to devour,
consuming with ferocious greed, others are starved by scarcity.

This is, of course, a produced scarcity, constructed through a mechanism
that negates the personhood of some subjects, human and nonhuman, to
classify them as exploitable resources and consume them indiscriminately
in the name of Western and capitalist notions of development. As soon as
the human bodies exploited within this cycle cease to work in its favor,
perhaps due to disease, hunger, conflict, or death; as soon as the
material repercussions of this process emerge (food shortages, water
contamination, an increase in global temperature, natural disasters),
scarcity is declared. There is now not enough food and water for all;
there are not enough natural resources to sustain so many living,
breathing human bodies. Krenak asks, pointedly: ‘Natural resources for
whom? Sustainable development for what? What is there to sustain?’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_6]
The foundations of coloniality and capitalism have always hinged on this
construction of scarcity: in order for wealth to exist, so too must
poverty. In order for some to live, some must die. In order for some to
be satisfied, others must be eaten. Although produced through a complex
network of power relations, scarcity has become a defining, tangible
circumstance in the lives of those on the margins of a world still
scarred by colonial wounds; a world where the sky blackens and falls,
and paths are painted toxic red. The imagined isn’t imaginary.

## There Is No Room

The narrative of scarcity needs a corresponding one – that of excess,
directed at those whose bodies and lives are framed as exploitable
resources in the quest for the accumulation of wealth through endless
economic growth. The people for whom food, water, land, shelter, care,
affection, and dignity will not be afforded. On July 11, 2017, BBC host
Victoria Derbyshire interviewed philanthropist Melinda Gates and the
United Kingdom Secretary of State for International Development at the
time, Priti Patel, on her \#VictoriaLIVE segment. The topic of
discussion was birth control, particularly the initiatives led in the
Global South by the Gates Foundation (co-chaired by the philanthropist
and Patel’s husband) and the UK government.

Birth control, Gates and Patel stressed, is a pivotal issue for fighting
poverty in the Global South, for it allows women in these regions to
continue their education, contribute to the local economy, and better
provide for smaller, planned families. The programs initiated by the
Gates Foundation are necessary, Gates argued, in order to address the
conditions brought about by a ‘population bulge’ that has, in her words,
caused the ‘biggest population of adolescents we’ve ever had in the
history of the Earth’ to be currently ‘coming through the developing
world.’ If denied access to birth control, this population will be
condemned to a ‘life of destitute poverty’, she continued, whereas ‘if
you can offer a girl contraceptives, she will stay in school.’ Patel
additionally asserted that population growth in the ‘developing world’
doesn’t only have a negative impact on local economies, it also puts
undue pressure on the United Kingdom’s resources and, more importantly,
leads to increases in the flow of migrants to the country.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_7]

The rhetoric employed by Gates and Patel, which positions poverty and
scarcity as a direct result of population growth, dates back centuries.
In 1798, British scholar Thomas Malthus published *An Essay on the
Principles of Population*. In it, he argues that the while a nation’s
ability to produce food could increase arithmetically, its populace
would grow exponentially, leading to a destructive cycle that would
culminate in what is known as a Malthusian catastrophe. He writes:

> The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to
> produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape
> or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and
> able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great
> army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves.
> But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons,
> epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep
> off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still
> incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with
> one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_8]

Though not the first to propose these ideas, Malthus remains their most
famous advocate. Anthropologist Eric Ross notes that Malthusian theories
have been fundamental ‘to provide an enduring argument for the
prevention of social and economic change and to obscure, in both
academic and popular thinking, the real roots of poverty, inequality and
environmental deterioration.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_9] Through the Malthusian lens, scarcity
is not an inevitable – and desired – outcome of capitalist systems, but
rather a result of the actions and choices of the poor.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_10] Since
Malthus’s initial formulation, his arguments have been periodically
revisited and recycled by academics and activists alike, from Paul
Ehrlich (one of the first biologists to blame environmental collapse on
overpopulation)[^06PradoWordsWorlds_11] to Margaret Sanger, whose crusade for the right to
birth control in the early 20^th^ century was animated by the perception
that many of the problems that afflicted poor women were results of
unregulated fertility.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_12]

Scholars Kalpana Wilson and Laura Briggs stress, however, that
population control policies implemented in the Global South, which are
underscored by Neo-Malthusian beliefs and advanced with the financial
and political incentives of Northern nations, need to be understood as
continuations of the colonial/imperial project, in that they pathologize
the sex and reproduction of colonial subjects for the benefit of
colonizers.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_13] Interventions on the fertility and sexuality of
colonial subjects are thus framed as necessary and beneficial. In the
rhetoric of humanitarian aid presented by Patel and Gates, they are
described as strategies for the empowerment of women and girls, devised
to effectively introduce this demographic into the (low-paid) workforce
of the Global South. Although both interviewees specifically used the
designation ‘developing countries’ to politically and geographically
position the subjects of the policies and programs they discuss, this
designation obfuscates the complexity and diversity of the colonial
subjects whose sexualities and fertilities are matters of such scrutiny.
As a result, this designation also obscures the ways in which population
control policies have been fundamental for the preservation of colonial
racial hierarchies in the United States, as has been thoroughly
documented and discussed by scholars such as Dorothy Roberts,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_14]
Angela Davis,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_15] Elena Gutiérrez,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_16] and Anne Hendrixson.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_17]
Patel’s argument, in particular, aligns itself with the discourse
associating population growth in the Global South with threats to
national identity and security, identified by Hendrixson as a
fundamental rationale behind US – and, I would expand, Western –
military interventionism in the Middle East, and the surveillance of
Muslims and Arabs circulating within US and European borders.

The works of Wilson and Briggs focus primarily on how organizations and
institutions based in the US or Europe promote these policies in the
Global South; a similar racist logic, however, also governs healthcare
initiatives deployed by many institutions and organizations within the
Global South, directed at locally marginalized communities. The
systematic, nonconsensual, mass sterilization of Indigenous peoples in
Peru during the regime of dictator Alberto Fujimori in the 1990s is one
such instance.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_18] In Brazil, anthropologist Emilia Sanabria documented
the widespread and coercive administration of the birth-control shot
Depo-Provera to low-income women who resort to government-funded family
planning services in the city of Salvador.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_19] Current Brazilian
President Jair Bolsonaro has long publicly supported many of Fujimori’s
ideas, defending strict population control policies aimed at the
country’s poorest as a way to ‘control criminality and poverty.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_20]
Bolsonaro’s rhetoric is far from unique: historically, population
control policies have been presented in Brazil as carrying positive
economic implications for the general population,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_21] a strategy to
ward off the impending threat of scarcity.

Further complicating this scenario, as conversations on the climate
crisis and its current and future impacts gain more prominence, concerns
over possible connections between overpopulation, the increase of global
temperatures, and fears of widespread scarcity have been placed once
again in the spotlight – to the point that acts of white supremacist
violence have been animated by the fear of a looming climactic disaster
triggered by the presence of brown and black people within the borders
of Western nations.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_22] The idea of bodies in excessive abundance is
inseparable from the colonial structures that have long sought to
classify humans into hierarchical categories. Rhetoric becomes fear
becomes policy becomes violence becomes rhetoric; a process woven into
the everyday lives of those who, although they ‘hold on to this Earth,
are those who are forgotten along the borders of the planet, the margins
of rivers, the shores of oceans, in Africa, in Asia, or in Latin
America.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_23] Though critical of the ‘population bomb’ rhetoric, in her
contribution to the book *Making Kin Not Population*, Donna Haraway
circles around the discourse of scarcity related to the climate crisis,
arguing that:

> Food production is a major contributor to climate change and the
> extinction crisis, with, as usual, those humans and nonhumans
> benefitting most suffering the least dire impacts. The super-peopling
> of the earth with both humans and industrial and pathogenic nonhumans
> is a worlding practice premised on the commitment to endless growth
> and vastly unequal well-being.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_24]

Although in this passage Haraway does leave room for a critique that
focuses on the systems and networks that construct scarcity within
capitalism, she later recants this line, writing that ‘blaming
Capitalism, Imperialism, Neoliberalism, Modernization, or some other
“not us” for ongoing destruction webbed with human numbers will not
work.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_25] Additionally, she maintains that ‘anti-racist feminist
avoidance of thinking and acting in public about the pressing urgencies
of human and nonhuman global populations is akin to the denial of
anthropogenic climate change by some deeply believing US
Christians’,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_26] and goes so far as to ‘only half-jokingly call for a
sliding scale approach to global reduction of human numbers.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_27] Under
this system, she suggests, those willing to birth a human baby would
need to collect tokens from other prospective parents; the number of
necessary tokens would vary according to the parents’ cultural,
economic, racial, and ethnic background. Haraway’s argument fails to
consider that not all humans relate to the Earth in the same way; while
she does admit that those living in so-called developed Western
societies might impact the planet differently from people living in
other societal organizations, this admission does not make its way into
the core logic of her argument. Let us return again to Krenak, who
remarks:

> If we imprinted upon the planet Earth a mark so heavy that it
> characterizes an era, which may remain even after we are no longer
> here, because we are exhausting the sources of life that allow us to
> prosper and feel that we are home \[…\] it is because we are again in
> front of a dilemma I have already alluded to: we exclude from life,
> locally, the forms of organization that are not integrated to the
> world of commodities, risking all other forms of living – at least the
> ones we thought of as possible, where there was co-responsibility to
> the places we live and the respect for the life of beings, and not
> only this abstraction we allowed ourselves to construct as one
> humanity, which excludes all others and other beings.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_28]

While Haraway insists this system would not be imposed but rather
willingly embraced, her speculative proposal relies on the assumption of
good will from all involved. Five hundred years of history have,
however, abundantly shown this is not the case. As long as some people
are perceived as not fully human, any such system is bound to facilitate
violence being inflicted upon already marginalized populations – those
living at the blunt end of what philosopher Maria Lugones calls the
colonial/modern gender system. This system, Lugones clarifies, is
fundamental to the establishment and continuation of the colonial
project, and includes what she calls a ‘light’ and a ‘dark’ side which
operate in distinct ways, and act upon distinct bodies. Hegemonic (that
is, European) constructions of gender and sex/sexuality are
characteristic of the ‘light’ side of the colonial/modern gender system,
which orders ‘the lives of white bourgeois men and women’.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_29]
Concurrently, this light side constructs the meaning (epistemological
and ontological) of the modern categories of ‘men’ and ‘women’.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_30]

The ‘dark’ side to the colonial/modern gender system governs the lives
of those who exist outside of white bourgeois heteropatriarchy. Both
sides of this gender system are violent, yet they manifest this inherent
violence in different ways. Whereas white women are encumbered with
perpetuating the white race – as Angela Davis has also highlighted[^06PradoWordsWorlds_31]
– women of color are ‘understood as animals in the deep sense of
“without gender”, sexually marked as female, but without the
characteristics of femininity.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_32] In the rhetoric of harm reduction
related to the climate crisis, similar arguments are translated into
calls for the surveillance of fertility – many similar to Haraway’s –
framed as necessary and beneficial for the entire world’s population.
Concurrently, the uncomfortable fact of the Global North’s perpetual
hunger for disposable goods, exploitable bodies, and natural resources –
all key factors in the ongoing crisis – often remains un- or
under-examined. Instead the blame is shifted to those existing under the
duress inflicted through centuries of colonial domination, which as
Krenak stresses, is in itself an ongoing project of world-ending.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_33]
Ultimately, these concerns reveal the perversity of calls for care –
reproductive care, in particular – that do not adequately address
underlying capitalist-colonial articulations. This in itself is a
violence, one more way of consuming an ‘other’.

Predictably, the narrative of climate crisis linked to uncontrolled
reproduction is materialized in technologies currently being developed
to provide so-called solutions to the perceived problem of
overpopulation. A notable example is that of the startup Microchips
Biotech, backed by the Gates Foundation and partnered with Israeli
company Teva Pharmaceutical, whose flagship product, announced in 2014,
is a remote-controlled smart birth-control implant that had been planned
for commercial release in 2018.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_34] The microchip can be turned on and
off with a proprietary app controlled by a physician; it is designed to
work for up to sixteen years – so for a large part of one’s fertile life
– as opposed to the three years of existing contraceptive implants.
Additionally, the implant could collect a number of data points about
patients, ostensibly to provide tailored healthcare solutions. The chip,
Bill Gates clarified in 2014, was being conceived with the developing
world in mind, more so than Western audiences, the rationale being that
in these regions, it would mean a ‘form of reproductive justice’, rather
than merely a ‘lifestyle choice’,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_35] and could be distributed as part
of the numerous birth-control programs initiated by the foundation in
the Global South. As of 2019, no new information has been publicly
released about the project.

The mass distribution of devices like the Microchips implant could have
serious implications for the digitalized biometric surveillance of those
living on the ‘dark side’ of the colonial/modern gender system. These
bodies have long been hypervisible, targets of surveillance by public
and private actors. In order to understand the wide-ranging implications
of this surveillance, however, it is fundamental to approach
‘reproduction’ as a broader set of life-making practices and
articulations, rather than as a strictly biological process. Returning
to the question of scarcity helps reframe the oft-repeated narrative of
‘choice’ pushed by many white Western feminists in relation to
reproduction. Scarcity – of food, housing, healthcare, education,
adequate climactic conditions – is precisely the argument that animates
much of the supposed necessity for contraceptive technologies such as
the one developed by Microchips Biotech in the Global South and so
insistently pushed by the likes of Gates and Patel. It follows that in
order to avoid scarcity, these subjects then must be monitored, their
fertility controlled ‘for their own good’, considered incapable of
making such decisions on their own. So goes the perverse narrative of
‘care’ tied to scarcity: the vulnerable must accept and be grateful for
any apparent help provided by the same powerful actors who profit from
that vulnerability in the first place.

It is also fundamental to consider that the lived experience of
constructed scarcity has profound effects on the paths and choices one
feels compelled to follow. In 18^th^ century Surinam, naturalist Maria
Sibylla Merian documented the use of an infusion of peacock flower by
enslaved Indigenous and African peoples as a way to provoke abortions.
This, Merian stressed, was a reaction to the conditions of extreme
violence to which these people were subjected; they did so, she wrote,
‘so that their children will not become slaves like they are.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_36]
Currently, although the threat of climate disasters looms over the
entire planet, there is still a sharp distinction between those most
affected, and those who command the resources to survive the oncoming
catastrophe. The dominant narrative of the climate crisis is one of
suffering delegated to someone else, somewhere else by an economic
system that hinges on the production of scarcity for some in order to
offer wealth for others. It is a narrative that negates the personhood
of beings: human and nonhuman, living and not yet or no longer embodied
– a lingering effect of the colonial hierarchies that have long been
used to justify the expropriation of land, exploitation of bodies, and
extraction of so-called resources. It is a narrative that feeds the
colonial hunger for homogenization and globalization, which seeks to
‘suppress diversity, deny the plurality of forms of life, existence, and
habits’, offering ‘the same menu, the same costumes and, if possible,
the same language to all.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_37] And so those who ‘hold on to this Earth’
are pushed and shoved into a monocultural, universalizing narrative,
while simultaneously remaining ‘forgotten along the borders of the
planet, the margins of rivers, the shores of oceans’,[^06PradoWordsWorlds_38] navigating
the same perverse plot that produced and produces this marginalization.
When dark skies loom above, however, Krenak reminds us: ‘There are so
many small constellations of people scattered all over the world who
dance, sing, make rain.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_39] World-endings have happened so many times
before, marking the margins of the world like scars, but ‘when you feel
the sky is getting too low, all you have to do is to push it back and
breathe.’[^06PradoWordsWorlds_40]

## An Abundance of Small Gestures

How is it possible, then, to create the conditions for life within a
political system designed to produce death? How to counteract a
narrative of scarcity for which the only resolution presented by the
current system is the total consumption of the Earth, and with it all of
the persons – human and nonhuman, living and not yet or no longer
embodied – who exist in relation to it? How to sustain radical,
decolonizing practices of care and affect that directly challenge the
infrastructures that monitor and restrict the ability to create futures
and sustain worlds that are multiple, plural, heterogenous?

In 2019, I undertook a joint residency between transmediale and the
Universität der Künste Berlin to work on a project titled ‘The Councils
of the Pluriversal: Affective Temporalities of Reproduction and Climate
Change’. In it, I intended to convene the Councils – a series of
meetings with activists, artists, elders, and thinkers hailing from
marginalized groups in Northern nations, and the Global South. In these
events I would propose discussions pertaining to the entanglements
between the climate crisis, reproduction, ancestral and future
histories, land and belonging, and radical, decolonizing forms of care.
A guiding principle to these events would be the notion of ‘*un mundo
donde quepan muchos mundos*’ – that is, a world in which many worlds fit
– a conception first advanced by the Zapatista liberation movement in
Mexico:

> Many words are walked in the world. Many worlds are made. Many worlds
> make us. There are words and worlds that are lies and injustices.
> There are words and worlds that are truthful and true. We make
> truthful worlds. We are made by truthful words. In the world of the
> powerful there is space only for the big and their servants. In the
> world we want there is space for all. The world we want is a world
> where many worlds fit. The nation we build is one that may fit all the
> peoples and their languages, that may be walked by all gaits, that may
> be laughed in, that may be awoken.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_41]

This conception rejects universalizing impulses toward consensus,
favoring instead temporal, spatial, and infrastructural multiplicities
that nurture the emergence of epistemological and ontological
complexity. ‘The Councils of the Pluriversal’ were conceived as dialogic
and idiosyncratic events, not meant to provide exhaustive, unifying, or
definitive summaries of issues of care, temporalities, reproduction, and
climate change, but rather to provide possible points of entry to think
and act through these issues.

Throughout the research process, I had the honor and privilege to
strengthen and expand affective bonds of care and intimacy with a number
of people operating within the vastly distinct contexts of Rio de
Janeiro and Boa Vista, Brazil, and Berlin, Germany. I extend my deepest
gratitude to Dagmar Schultz and Ika Hügel-Marshall in Berlin; to Vó
Bernaldina, Jaider Esbell, Paula Berbert, Raquel Blaque, Amazoner
Arawak, Parmênio Citó, and Caio Clímaco in Boa Vista; as well as to the
hundreds of activists I encountered in the streets of Rio, protesting
while caring for one another, and keeping each other safe. These bonds
were not all started as part of this project; most were existing
relationships that had emerged through shared interests in the struggle
for decolonization, as well as for reproductive and climate justice.
Some of these bonds extended, too, to nonhuman beings – the *lavrado*
vegetation, the rivers and *igarapés* of the state of Roraima, where Boa
Vista is located[^06PradoWordsWorlds_42] – as well as to human beings no longer embodied –
in particular, to Audre Lorde and May Ayim, whose truth in words and
worlds is capable of transcending life itself.

Most importantly, all of these persons were already, through their
practices – as activists, artists, curators, singers, cooks,
storytellers, curators, cultural workers, writers, poets, filmmakers,
educators, and care workers, among others – conducting their own
versions of what I had come to call ‘The Councils of the Pluriversal’.
Amongst all of the experiences I had while developing this research,
this was perhaps the most significant and humbling realization: art,
particularly politically oriented art, often risks gravitating toward
grand, sensational gestures. These become performances that benefit
those who hold power, including artists themselves, far more than those
actually affected by the issues at hand.

There was no need for me to name the Councils as such; they already
existed in alternate forms, practiced by people whose sincerity,
commitment, and deep understanding of their communities and peers allow
them to articulate spaces where ever-evolving forms of caring for one
another can emerge across an extended period of time. This type of
maintenance work is made of smaller gestures with long-term
repercussions, gestures that trouble the narrative of scarcity advanced
by capitalism, and point toward other possibilities, other realities,
other worlds where abundance – of time, generosity, affection, patience
– is possible. This work is Makuxi elder Vó Bernaldina preparing
*damurida*, an ancestral fish stew made with local ingredients, cooked
in a pot made with clay borrowed from the land, and eaten with cassava
flour, for those who arrive to visit artist Jaider Esbell’s gallery in
Boa Vista. It is artist and cook Raquel Blaque repurposing the leftovers
with foraged local herbs and vegetables to feed a group of school
students who wanted a space where they could engage with Indigenous art,
and discuss the ongoing fires that consumed the forest south of Boa
Vista. It is artist and anthropologist Amazoner Arawak sharing stories
on Wapixana cosmologies, and the exploitation of Indigenous material
cultures by European cultural institutions over a bottle of
*caxiri*.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_43] It is Jaider’s generosity in opening up his life, his
gallery, his home to those who arrive in Boa Vista with the intent to
live and exchange and learn. It is a group of young students holding a
large placard protesting the burning of the Amazon in Rio de Janeiro and
being fed by their peers, so that they wouldn’t need to drop the sign.
It is Dagmar Schultz and Ika Hügel-Marshall, lifelong friends of Audre
Lorde, cooking a meal in their home to introduce young feminist,
anti-racist, and environmental activists to one another – in the same
way Lorde did, too. It is Vó Bernaldina singing a Makuxi song
celebrating the recognition of the Raposa Serra do Sol territory as
Indigenous land.

Developing bonds of affection is a long-term process, as remarked by
Ailton Krenak to art worker and cultural producer Paula Berbert and
relayed to me in conversation. It is only through nurturing sincere,
solid relationships that the conditions for sustaining life can emerge;
that truly pluriversal modes of engaging with each other and with the
world can come into being. Counteracting the narrative of scarcity
demands abundance. In the end, instead of convening councils as I had
imagined, the main avenue of work became an exploration of these
different forms of relating and practicing care with other bodies, human
and nonhuman; the beginning of a long-term engagement, whose first
ramifications will be presented at transmediale 2020. After all, as
Krenak points out:

> Why does the feeling of falling cause us such discomfort? We haven’t
> done anything lately but fall. Fall, fall, fall. So why are we worried
> about the process of falling? Let us use all of our critical and
> creative capacity to build colorful parachutes. Let us think of space
> not as a confined place, but as a cosmos where we can fall with
> colorful parachutes.[^06PradoWordsWorlds_44]

Decolonization is not an individual choice; it demands collective,
sustained, committed work. Let us feed these visions for a future of
blue skies and open paths. Let us nourish each other with
responsibility, care, affection, and patience.
